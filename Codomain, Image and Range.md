This note explains some terminology used to describe the sets involved in a function mapping.

For a function with the mapping $f: A \to B$ . The set $B$ is called the codomain while the range is what in $B$ actually gets mapped. The range is therefore a subset of the codomain. The codomain is all of $B$ and the range is what actually gets mapped. The range is sometimes also referred to as the <u>image</u> but the use of image/range is sometimes used ambiguously as the codomain or the subset of the codomain that gets mapped. In summary:
1) ***Codomain***. Also called the set destination or counter domain is the entire set $B$ in the output of the mapping.
2) ***Range***. The subset of the codomain that actually has a mapping. Also called the image but these 2 terms ambiguously refer to the codomain sometimes.
