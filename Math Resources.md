## Calculus
- [_**A Course of Pure Mathematics**_ - G.H. Hardy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Course_of_Pure_Mathematics)
- [_**Differential and Integral Calculus**_- Richard Courant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Courant)
    - Apostol is more thorough but less discussion on applications when compared to [Fritz and Courant](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/63504/suggest-textbook-on-calculus). Apostol seems to be the more popular one among mathematicians
- _**Analysis on Manifolds**_ by James Munkres
	- More suited as a 2nd course in calculus per [Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1190170/munkres-analysis-on-manifolds-and-differential-geometry)and used as as a second advanced calculus course at MIT
Advanced Multivariable Calculus reference request on [Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/44522/theoretical-multivariable-calculus-textbooks)
### Calculus of Variations
- _**Calculus of Variations**_ - Gelfand and Fomin
	- Recommended several times on [Stackexchange](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/129122/good-book-on-calculus-of-variations) and also used in Control theory [subreddit](Engineering.md#^1541ca) 
## Statistics and Probability
Meta analysis of Stackexchange books [here](https://bookinsider.gitlab.io/2018/12/01/top-books-on-stats/) ^eec26e

Also a compilation of books on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/2le25z/what_books_or_papers_are_must_reads_for_every/)
List of important publications [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_statistics) ^6bb376
- _**Statistical Inference**_ - Casella and Berger
- _**Introduction to Probability**_- William Feller
	- Feller was one of the masters and pioneered the probability as a field in mathematics. [Remember Abel](Neils%20Heinrich%20Abel.md)
- _**Probability Theory: A Comprehensive Course**_ - Klenke
	- For Grad Students. Advanced per the preface and is highly regarded per meta-analysis of [Stackexchange](Math%20Resources.md#^0fdb2c)
### Meta Analysis
Only seen one [recommendation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/248311/which-is-the-best-book-to-learn-meta-analysis) and Hedges seems to appear a lot in meta analysis. Borenstein is also liked on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/8ebggf/request_a_overviewintroduction_to_meta_analysis/)
- _**Statistical Methods for Meta Analysis**_ - Olkin and Hedges
	- More theoretical of the two Hedges books
- _**Introduction to Meta Analysis** - Borenstein and Hedges
	- The more practical of the two books
### Design of Experiment
Per [Stackexchange review](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1815/recommended-books-on-experiment-design), Delaney and E.P. Box are highly regarded. Should probably look at the Cochran books into Hinkelmann as they are more brief and Cochran is a pioneer on the subject.
- _**Experimental Design**_ - Cox and Cochran
	- Both Cochran books are highly regarded on [Stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/179067/what-should-a-graduate-course-in-experimental-design-cover). This is the less mathematical of the two
- _**Theory of the Design of Experiments**_ - Cochran
	- This is the more mathematical compared to _**Experimental Design**_ by the same Cochran per this [review](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/179067/what-should-a-graduate-course-in-experimental-design-cover)
- Statistical Design - Casella
- _**Design and Analysis of Experiments**_ (2 volumes) - Hinkelmann and Kempthorne
	- Considered a DOE bible on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/t7qics/q_whats_the_best_book_on_experimental_design_im/). Note this has 2 volumes
-  _**Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A Model Comparison Perspective**_ - Delaney
### Quasi-Experimental
- _**Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Generalized Causal Inference**_- William R. Shadish and Thomas D. Cook
    - This one is apparantly a classic per [this review on Stackexhange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/173682/textbooks-readings-on-what-to-do-when-you-cant-create-an-ideal-experiment) and this [review as well](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/4784/ref-request-book-or-survey-about-conducting-experimental-studies)
### Sampling
- _**Sampling: Design and Analysis**_ -Sharon Lohr 
	- This is highly rated on the Stackexchange [Meta-Analysis](Math%20Resources.md#^eec26e)
- _**Sampling techniques**_ - Cochran
    - more mathematical and rigorous per this [review on Stackexhange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/164420/introductory-graduate-level-survey-sampling-textbook) compared to Sharon Lohr that also gets recommended a lot. It's also by Cochran of all people. 
- _**Survey Sampling**_ - Kish
    - also well regarded per same reviewer above
### Survival
- The Statistical Analysis of Failure Time Data - Kalbfleish
	- Recommended as an important publication on [Wikipedia and Reddit](Math%20Resources.md#^6bb376). One of the first treatments on survival analysis
### General
Should especially look to read applied statistics and read the father of statistics Ronald Fischer and George EP Box:
- _**Design of Experiment**_ - Fischer
	-  Introduced the Null hypothesis
- _**Statistical Methods for Research Workers**_ - Donald Fischer
- _**Statistics for Experimenters**_ (2nd ed., 2005), - E. P. Box
Statistics doesn't seem to generate much buzz with mathematicians, but here are some recommended advanced works after Casella from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_statistics)
- _**Combinatorics of Experimental Design**_ - Anne Street
	- Connects Statistics to combinatorics
### Multivariate Statistics
- _**An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis**_ - Anderson
	- Seems to be one of the more mathemtical and classic treatments of multivariate statistics  per [Stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/67146/recommendations-for-mathematical-multivariate-statistics-with-exercises) But the preface does mention its for graduates
### Categorical Statistics
- _**Categorical Data Analysis**_ - Agresti
	- This is highly rated on stackexchange[ meta analysis](Math%20Resources.md#^eec26e)
### Time Series
- _**Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control**_ - E. P. Box
	- On list of important publications per [Wikipedia](Math%20Resources.md#^6bb376)
Take some time to leaf through this [review](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3993990/book-recommendation-on-time-series-statistics) for books used by economists/finance for time series analysis
### Bayes
- Bayesian Data Analysis - Gelman
	- This is highly recommended on [Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/133230/books-for-understanding-bayesian-probability-from-the-beginning) and also liked on [reddit](Math%20Resources.md#^6bb376) and is highly rated on the Stackexchage [meta analysis](Math%20Resources.md#^eec26e). Note that this title is for the newer version of this  [older version](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/052168689X)
- _**Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis**_ - George Box
	-  Can be my first Bayesian statistics book. That was listed as a historic publication on [Wikipedia](Math%20Resources.md#^6bb376)
- [_Theory of statistics_](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/414/introduction-to-statistics-for-mathematicians) -Schirvish
	- Is mentioned to be relevant to Bayes Statistics per [Stackexchange](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/100288/bayesian-statistics-for-pure-mathematicians)
- _**Introduction to statistical decision theory**_ - John Pratt
	- Required reading for doctoral Harvard Business School students

## ODE
[[Rota's Criticism of Modern Pedagogy of Differential Equations]]
[Pretty representative summary of what I've seen for review of ODE books](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4119586/looking-for-a-2nd-book-on-ordinary-differential-equations). People really like Hirsch and Coddington. Should probably look at both
- _**Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and Linear Algebra**_ - Hirsch
- _**Theory of ordinary differential equations**_-Coddington
- _**Ordinary Differential Equations**_-Morris and Tennenbaum
- _**Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes**_- George Simmons
	- Per the preface, this is more of a graduate book as it presupposes some algebra, topology and real analysis and is not confident in recommending it for even senior undergraduates

## PDE
The following are easier books than Evans that were pretty [well regarded as an intermediate](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/72318/textbooks-for-pde-between-strauss-and-folland). Math StackExchange itself doesn't seem too keen on PDEs
- _**Partial Differential Equations**_ - Strauss
	- Very basic
- _**Partial Differential Equations**_ - John Fritz
	- Of calculus with Courant. I did like that particular textbook because of its applications. This is also a shorter book that I can easily dive into and compare to Strauss
-  _**Partial Differential Equations**_ - Laurence Evans
	- Advanced but highly regarded
## Discrete mathematics
- _**Concrete Mathematics**_ - Donald Knuth
## Real Analysis
Abbott, Rudin, and Folland are highly rated on [Stackexchange](Math%20Resources.md#^0fdb2c). Abbott seems to be the better introduction
- _**Understanding Analysis**_ - Abbot
    -  A junior undergraduate book that's highly rated. Should read before Baby Rudin or Folland
- _**Principles of Mathematical Analysis**_ (Baby Rudin)
    - More of a senior book
- _**Real analysis: Modern Techniques and their Application**_- Folland
    + More of a senior book
## Complex Analysis
- _**Complex Analysis**_  Lars Ahlfors
	- Field medalist and one of the most highly rated books on Stackexchange
- _**Complex Variables and its Applications**_ - Churchill
	- Consensus on a alternative with more engineering applications per [Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/30749/what-is-a-good-complex-analysis-textbook-barring-ahlforss) 
- _**Visual Complex Analysis**_ - Tristan Needham
	- Geometric approach compared to classical approach to complex analysis
Another book I heard about was Conway that apparantly was written when [he was a student](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1384391/books-on-complex-analysis-ahlfors-conway-and-lang) and has some issues
## Number Theory
- _**Introduction to the Theory of Numbers**_ - Hardy
- _**Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory**_ by Ireland and Rosen
    - Review on relative difficulty of the books [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2313176/number-theory-book-recommendation)
    - [Some review on the pedagogical effectiveness](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/6074/differences-between-hardywright-and-irelandrosen-for-number-theory-course). Suggests that Rosen is more advanced. Apparantly it presupposes some [abstract algebra](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2558371/prerequisites-for-a-classical-introduction-to-modern-number-theory-by-rosen-an?rq=1)
## Algebra
- _**Abstract Algebra**_ - Dummit and Foote
    - highly regarded undergraduate book mentioned frequently [On StackExhange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/54839/good-abstract-algebra-books-for-self-study?noredirect=1&lq=1). Main criticisms is it is rather long and perhaps should be used more as a reference instead of as a primary text
The following seem more concise than Dummit and Foote
-  _**First Course in Abstract Algebra**_ - Fraleigh
	- Highly regarded on  [Stackexchange](Math%20Resources.md#^0fdb2c)
- _**A Book of Abstract Algebra**_ - Pinter
	- Highly regarded on  [Stackexchange](Math%20Resources.md#^0fdb2c)
- _**Topics in Algebra**_ - Herstein
	- [Seems like a better introductory book than Dummit and Foote due to being more concise](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/198373/choosing-an-abstract-algebra-text)
## Geometry
- _**Foundations of Geometry**_ - David Hilbert
	- One of the reformulations of Euclidean geometry on a modern axiomatic basis
## Topology
_**Topology**_ - Munkres
    - acknowledged as a good intro to the topic [here](Math%20Resources.md#^84322d)
## Applied
- [_**Methoden der mathematischen Physik**_- Courant and Hilbert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoden_der_mathematischen_Physik)^m123
## Linear Algebra and numerical methods
- [_**Linear Algebra**_ - Gilbert Strang](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1040/which-linear-algebra-texts-should-i-read-before-learning-numerical-linear-algebr)
- _**Linear Algebra**_ - Friedberg and Insel
- [_**Linear Algebra Done Right**_-Axler Sheldon](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1040/which-linear-algebra-texts-should-i-read-before-learning-numerical-linear-algebr)
- _**Linear Algebra**_-Hoffman and Kunze 
     - this one is fairly advanced
## Numerical Methods
- [_**Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3**_](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/Numerical_Methods_in_Engineering_with_Py.html?id=aJkXoxxoCoUC&redir_esc=y)
- [_**Python For Data Analysis: Data Wrangling With Pandas, Numpy, and Jupyter**_ by Wes McKinney](https://pythonbooks.org/topical-books/numeric-and-big-data/)
- [_**Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers**_-Richard Hamming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming)
- _**Numerical linear algebra**_ - Trefethen
- _**Coding The Matrix: Linear Algebra Through Computer Science Applications**_
