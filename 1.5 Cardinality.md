We explore the big brain of Georg Cantor who found a way to compare infinities and show how some infinities are larger than others. In this section we develop the following:
- A method and definition to compare the "size" of a set to another set
- Use this method to show that $N$ is the same "size" as $Z,Q$ but $R$ is "larger" than $N$ which implies that there are way more irrational numbers than rational numbers

We use the idea of a function's 1-1 mapping to compare the size of a set by saying that a set can be thought of as equal "size" to another set if there exists a function such that every element in that set can be mapped out. 

We first define the tools we will use.

***Definition 1.5.1.*** a function $f: A\to B$ has a one-to-one (1-1)  if $a_1\ne a_2$ then $f(a_1) \ne f(a_2)$. The function is "onto" if for every $b \in B$ there exists an $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$ 

A function being 1-1 means that if an element in $B$ is mapped, then precisely only one unique $a$ gets mapped by it. Every value in the domain gets its own unique value in the range and no two values in the domain map to the same range value. And onto means that the range of the function contains all of $B$.

Using this definition we can now develop a definition to compare the size of a set using the following definition called cardinality

***Definition 1.5.2 Cardinality.*** A set $A$ has the same cardinality as a set $B$ if there exists a function
