The chronologically earliest philosophy of science that PGS discusses is logical positivism and its later more moderate form logical empiricism. The chapter begins with a brief overview of the history and the forces that logical positivism reacted against. To summarize the logical positivist's position, PGS first starts with their two ideas on language which serves as the framework for the role they play in science and how science should be done. It should be noted that PGS frequently impresses on the reader that the views presented by the prominent philosophers shifted over time and that they were frequently misinterpreted in his opinion, but nonetheless, the points they made still stand and their is value in looking at why their early views had changed or were rebutted by others.
# 2.2 Vienna Circle
PGS provides a history of logical positivism and decided the most productive way to do so was to show what logical positivism was a reaction to that lead to its formation. It should be noted that the philosophy that PGS goes through is beyond the scope of the book and so I will not go into great detail on the details of their philosophy. Suffice to say, the logical positivists such as Carnap and A.J. Ayer wanted to develop something more grounded in the practical and observable as opposed to the intuitive and metaphysical. The work lead to the corroboration of people known as the Vienna Circle who were reacting to the metaphysical work of people such as Heidegger and Hegel who they felt became to impractical, spiritual, and even politically, nationalist. In their view, philosophy has departed so far from the practical that it has lost all meaning and that it is any wonder that their works (most notably Heidegger) are so obtuse to understand. It should be noted that the members of the Vienna Circle were incredibly liberal and none were a part of the Nazi party during their formation in the 1920s to WWII and there was a sense that empiricism was a liberal movement
# 2.3 Central Ideas of Logical Positivism
The ideas of logical positivism are fundamentally theories of language that have uses in Science. PGS begins with the two main ideas of language held by logical positivists before moving on to the role it plays in Science. These two ideas are 1) the analytic-synthetic distinction and 2) the verifiability theory of meaning.
### Analytic-Synthetic Statements and Math
Beginning with analytic-synthetic distinction, they are predicates used to describe statements. Synthetic statements are true or false by their meaning and how it relates to the world (e.g. "all bachelors are bald"). Analytic statements are true or false just by their meaning regardless of how the world works (e.g. "all bachelors are single"). The validity of an analytic statement is already implied by its definition, so they are essentially tautologies. They key thing here is that the logical positivists held that only analytic statements can be known a priori (known without any experience of the world) and held that mathematics and logic were analytic knowledge. This is in contrast to Kant who held the controversial position that math was an a priori synthetic language. Kant impressed by the application of Euclidean geometry formulated centuries before its application in Newtonian mechanics held that math can be known without empirical experience (a priori), but its judgements are not true by definition as it is the world that justifies it (synthetic). Almost ironically the development of non-Euclidean geometry and its application in Einsteinian physics demonstrated that Euclidean geometry is not universally true and that one can change frameworks (between Euclidean and non-Euclidean) to describe the world. In that sense they believed math is fundamentally analytic but that synthetic claims make use of the analytic statements.
### Verifiability theory of meaning. 
Here is how PGS formulated the logical positivists' verifiability theory of meaning: knowing the meaning of a sentence is knowing how to verify it. If a sentence has no means of verification, then it has no meaning. Verifiability may be a bad word and a better word is "testable". A sentence has meaning if it is testable. It should be noted that statement may not be practically verifiable/testable but it has to be so in principle. For example predicting a solstice may not be immediately conducted in an experiment, but given infinite resources or time, it is possible to do so. The early formulations of logical positivists applied this idea to science by trying to reduce every sentence into statements about sensations, but this was abandoned as too extreme of a view. But the essence remains, to be verifiable is rooted in empiricism for without empiricism, we lapse into meaningless statements from traditional philosophy.

In this way logical positivists draw a distinction between themselves and what they considered the nonsense, pretentious, and impractical propositions made in other branches of philosophy or "pseudo-science" as they do not satisfy this criteria of being testable.

### Applications of the two ideas to science
Impressed by the success of physics at the time (Einstein etc..) and the role math played. The logical positivists viewed science as a special form of investigation that sought to make meaningful statements grounded in observable phenomena, and could be explained within an abstract language such as math. In essence, the logical positivists viewed science as a series of meaningful statements that are significant because they are testable (verifiability theory of meaning) within an analytic framework that is math (synthetic-analytic distinction). For logical positivism, logic is the main tool for philosophy and "just about the only useful thing that philosophers can do is give logical analyses of how language, mathematics, and science works" (p.28).

At the same time, logical positivists were impressed with the developments made in formal deductive logic (Bertrand Russell, and Peano's axioms?) and sought to develop their own inductive logic to validate synthetic statements.

# 2.4 Problems and Challenges
Among fundamental problems in their development of inductive logic that are outside the scope of this book (see Hempel's Introduction to Philosophy of Natural Science and dealing with propositions like "p or q" where p is a meaningful statement and q is a nonsense statement for example "metals expand when heated or Barney stole my milkshake"), one systemic issue in the logical positivists ideas was brought about in Quine's "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" in that hypothesis consist of statements that are a bundle of auxiliary hypothesis to the point that it becomes difficult to isolate the validity of any single one as any attempts to test will only test the conjunction of these auxillary hypotheses. To satisfy the verifiability criteria of a sentence, we must find a way to holistically test for the bundle of hypothesis Quine acknowledged Pierre Duhem had also argued for "holistic testing" and so the difficulty to unambiguously verify any singular proposition is referred to as the Quine-Duhem thesis. The reality that most hypothesis are in reality a conjunction of several hypothesis is referred to as the "theory-ladenness". This problem pokes a hole in the verifiability theory of meaning for now the Quine-Duhem's thesis demonstrates that no hypothesis can be meaningfully tested for they are too theory-laden.

The other "dogma of empiricism" that Quine attacked in his essay was the analytic-synthetic distinction. The argument here may be outside the scope of this work as PGS only dedicated a brief unconvincing paragraph, but Quine uses quantum mechanics as an example of statements that appear analytic that ended up not being analytic and required revisions in logic, but the book does not elaborate on the counter-example. Its worth noting that PGS defended the logical positivist from Quine's claim that the positivists held that analytic statements are immune to revision. Carnap's philosophy had already permitted changes between logical/linguistic frameworks and changes within the frameworks as well (see historic examples with Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry).

# 2.6 On the Fall of Logical Empiricism
PGS ultimately attributed the fall of logical empiricism to four factors:
1) the breakdown of the view of language
2) Pressures from holist arguments on the ability for statements to be verifiable due to their theory-ladenness.
3) The failed attempts at an inductive logic (to be elaborated in chapter 3)
4) Development of the role of history, psychology, and sociology in the philosophy of science (elaborated in chapter 5-7)
