The Bach-Busoni edition is an instructive edition that is essentially a transcription of Bach's klavierwerke to the modern piano while containing actual transcriptions of his other non-keyboard or keyboard-tangential works like the Toccata and Fugue in D-minor for the organ.

The edition was originally published with a full 25 volumes with an additional volume for 6 transcriptions referred to as the Busoni Ausgabe, but there has been subsequent editions of a condensed 6-volume version referred to as the Bach-Busoni Collected Edition
