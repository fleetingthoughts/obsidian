# 2.1 Statements
- Statements are either definitely true or definitely false
- Statements can be represented by symbols
- If a statement $P$ says something about a variable x, we can write $P(x)$ 
# 2.2 And, Or, Not
- $P$ AND $Q$ is denoted $P \land Q$ 
- $P$ OR $Q$ is denoted $P \lor Q$ 
- NOT $P$ or the negation of $P$ is denoted $\lnot P$ 

# 2.3 Conditional Statements

The conditional statement "If $P$ then $Q$" is denoted by $P \implies Q$. This phrase has several different grammatical ways of being stated such as all the following:

- $P$ implies $Q$.
- If $P$, then $Q$ .
- $Q$ if $P$.
- $Q$ whenever $P$.
- $Q$, provided that $P$.
- Whenever $P$, then also $Q$.
- <u> $P$ is a sufficient condition for $Q$.</u>
- <u> For Q , it is sufficient that P.</u>
- <u> Q is a necessary condition for P</u>
- For P, it is necessary that Q.
- P only if Q.
Of the above list, one of the most common is relating the statements by "necessity and sufficiency".  In this case $P \implies Q$ means $P$ is <u>sufficient</u> for $Q$ or it can also be stated $Q$ is <u>necessary</u> for $P$ . Below is the truth table showing the relationship for sufficiency. Notice that if $P \implies Q$ , $P$ is not an absolute requirement for $Q$ for indeed $Q$ can be true without $P$ being true.

# 2.4 Biconditional Statements
It should be noted that $P \implies Q$ is not the same as $Q \implies P$  for one is called the <u>converse</u> of the other. In other words, a condition and its converse express entirely different things.
We now speak of the situation where $(P\implies Q)\land (Q \implies P)$ which is denoted and grammatically referred to as:
- $P\iff Q$ 
- "$P$ if and only if $Q$." (the most common one)
- "$P$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for $Q$" (necessity and sufficiency way of stating it)
- "$P$ is equivalent to $Q$"
- "If $P$, then $Q$, and conversely"
