This concept arose while solving exercise 1.8.8 from [Introduction to Mathematical Statistics 8th ed. - Hogg, McKean, Craig](Introduction%20to%20Mathematical%20Statistics%208th%20ed.%20-%20Hogg,%20McKean,%20Craig.md):
A bowl contains 10 chips, of which 8 are marked $2 each and 2 are marked
$5 each. Let a person choose, at random and without replacement, three chips from
this bowl. If the person is to receive the sum of the resulting amounts, find his
expectation

The expectation of the 2nd, 3rd,.. etc. draws are equal to the expectation of the first draw.
