When given a lump sum and the decision to invest it over time or to invest as a lump-sum, some investment wisdom advises that investing the lump sum slowly over a period of time, referred to as dollar-cost averaging (DCA), reduces volatility. The methodology supposes that investing the lump sum over time at fixed amounts allows one to naturally time the markets as you buy less shares when market prices are high and buy more when prices are low.

Vanguard Research produced a 2012 article reviewing the historic performance of DCA vs lump sum investment (LCI) and found that LCI typically outperforms [two-thirds](Shtekhman%20Dollar-Cost%20Averaging%2020122024-01-27%2014%20-%2005.md#^bbfd18) of the time producing returns averaging [2% more](Shtekhman%20Dollar-Cost%20Averaging%2020122024-01-27%2014%20-%2005.md#^078bb6). 

The research looked at the historical performance of the LSI and DCA methodology on the following factors:
- Asset allocation
- DCA investment period
-

> In the United States, 12-month DCA led to an average ending portfolio value of $2,395,824, while LSI led to an average ending value of $2,450,264, or 2.3% more. The results were similar in the United Kingdom and Australia: U.K. investors would have ended with 2.2% more and Australian investors with 1.3% more, on average.

> For LSI, we assume that US$1,000,000 (or Â£1,000,000 in the United Kingdom and A$1,000,000 in Australia) is immediately invested into a stock/ bond portfolio and then held for 10 years.

> then transferred in equal increments into a stock/bond portfolio over a period of 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 months

> We repeat the comparison over rolling periods; i.e., the first comparison for U.S. markets covers the 10 years from January 1926 through December 1935, the second covers February 1926 through January 1936, and so on until we reach the 10 years through December 2011. 

> [!quote|red]+ Highlight ([page. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCSSADHJ?page=3&annotation=44HFJPER))
> As noted earlier, in addition to the 12-month DCA shown in Figure 1, we calculated outcomes for 6-, 18-, 24-, 30-, and 36-month DCA investment periods, again using the rolling 10-year time frames in each market.

> Such articles tend to recommend DCA largely on the ground that investing a consistent dollar amount at regular intervals allows investors to diversify the prices they pay for a security, buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high 

> [!quote|grey]+ Highlight ([page. 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCSSADHJ?page=6&annotation=A597JKMB))
> Historically, a long-term upward trend has persisted for both equities and bonds, probably attributable to positive risk premia in the markets.
