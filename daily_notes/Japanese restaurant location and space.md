During my Japan trips, I found the majority of non-franchises restaurants and bars to be in hard to find places with minimal marketing such as on the higher floor of a smaller building.

This likely requires the Japanese market to go out of their way to find these restaurants. Perhaps a reflection of the market conditions where more onus is on the customer to more actively search for what they want reducing the advertising required by businesses. Similar expectations of the market were observed in [[card prices discrepancy between online prices and physical store prices]]
