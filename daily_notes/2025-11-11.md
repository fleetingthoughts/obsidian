Currently looking to find books to improve in the "Art of math" so to speak and develop maturity, problem solving, my mathematical toolbox and how to use that tool box. I found a resource in the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) that trains people to become math Olympians. Some books they recommended of interest include.

1) AoPS Introduction to Algebra
2) AoPS Intermediate Algebra
3) I.M. Gelfand - Algebra
4) I.M. Gelfand - Trignometry
5) Nicholas D. Kazarinoff - Geometric Inequalities
6) Beckenbach & Bellman - Introduction to Inequalities
7) AoPs - Precalculus
