The chapter discusses the popularity of mutual funds despite the rising popularity of index funds. This begs the question what are the advantages of mutual funds despite the high fees they incurr. MorningStar repeatedly reports Canada as having one of the worst mutual fund fees. The common stance for mutual funds are that you can find the ones that can beat the market, but notes that per the S&P scorecard, <18% of mutual funds beat the market benchmarks. What if we simply invest in the mutual funds that consistently beat the market? Surely past performance is an indicator of future performance. The S&P Dow Jones Persistence scorecard, <3% of these mutual funds remain as consistent performers over a 5 year time frame. The data here is likely subject to survivorship bias on top of the duplicitous tactics of poor-performing funds merging with better-performing funds to bias the data. ^48acec

The other alternative available to the individual investor is stock investing. The book argues that there is fundamentally no rational predictor of a stock's value and the common conceit that a companies' underlying value correlates with its price is false. The price of a stock is dependent on what other's think of the stock which is subject to the usual human irrationality. Any good predictor is subject to Goodhart's Law where any benchmark that is measured will fail its objective as any information becomes common knowledge and will be baked into the pricing of the stock leaving nothing to arbitrage. On top of that, the individual investor should be aware of who may be on the other side of his trades, professional mutual fund managers who have access to far more information than you and even they underperform. ^19088a

 Some history on how the idea of "beating the market" came about. The seminal books by Benjamin Graham "The intelligent investor" and "Security Analysis" preached the pricing of a company by its underlying value, but this was written in the early 1930s when the US had not yet passed laws forcing companies to disclose financial information. In the absence of public financial information, the stock market was a speculation market and this was the environment Benjamin Graham wrote for: in the absence of public information, there exists the opportunity for the smart investor to determine the underlying value of a company. But now that we're inundated with so much public information, the competition is so intense that for the retail investor, the value in this extensive research and analysis is no longer worth the cost and is more subject to the volatility of the irrationalities in the market. Additionally, during those times, the barrier of entry into market was so high that the idea of buying multiple stocks to diversify was not practical, hence why Graham's early books focused on individual stock evaluation.
