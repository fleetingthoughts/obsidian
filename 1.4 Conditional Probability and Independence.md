The conditional probability of an event $B$ given $A$ occurred is represented as follows:
$$P(B|A) = P(A \cap B|A)$$
This can be interpreted as $A$ which was a subset of the original sample space now being the new sample space to compute the probability of $B$ . 

***Definition 1.4.1*** Let $B$ and $A$ be events with P(A)>0. Then we define the conditional probability of $B$ given $A$ as:
$$ P(B|A)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}$$
The frequentist interpretation of conditional probability can be seen from the "multiplication" rule of probabilities $P(B|A)P(A)=P(A\cap B)$.
