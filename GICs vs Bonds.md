GIC:
- Backed by CDIC, the Crown, or a corporation within a limit of usually ~100,000 CAD
- Not actual securities that are exchanged but rather a product provided by an institution
	- Are therefore illiquid as they cannot be exchanged
- Protection against rising interests as it does not have a fundamental price that fluctates
- No yields from falling interest rates either
