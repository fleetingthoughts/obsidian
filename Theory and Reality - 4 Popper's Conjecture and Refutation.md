PGS begins with an admiration for the amount of influence that Popper had on the scientific community due to the simplicity of his ideas, but he notes that in the philosophical community, he has come under tough scrutiny that in his opinion, Popper cannot escape.

Author has a bone to pick with popper:
- People misinterpret Popper and do not realize he did not believe in support or confirmation.


- Motivations of Popper
	- demarcation of science
- Popper's thesis falsification (p .58) implications:
	- confirmation is a myth (distinguished from positivists)
	- deduction in its purest form as popper stresse
	- binary approach. No room for probability
- Descriptive and Normative basis of Popper's thesis
	- Views on scientific change. Simple only two changes conjecture -> refutation
	- normative: we should not make ad hocs to save hypothesis. A hypothesis should be as strong as possible measured by their ability to be refuted.
	- Normative: the individual and the institution strive for the same goal. No real distinction between the two
- Objections to falsification criteria:
	- Normative: The inability to refute due to Quine-duhem
		- Popper tries to refute by scaling back his refutability from a hard criteria to a general behaviour. Science is still differentiated by behaviour to make the binary decisions of refute or keep based on observations
		- We are ultimately reduced to judgement calls: e,g, Why can't we just have ad hocs
	- Conflicts with theories that are not bernoulli trials. What about theories that have probabilistic outcomes
		- To popper it is unscientific. It is up to community to decide an observable outcome to refute (i.e. an outcome so unlikely to occur). but this again goes back to the issue that we lose the demarcation of science is just a bunch of judgement calls. 
- Objections to confirmation being a myth
	- How do we ever create anything? How can engineers create bridges if they can never be sure it works. (Descriptive and normative)
		- corroboration
			- But this doesn't help distinguish an untested design from tested design
		- PGS's view is that popper should've stick to inductie skepticism instead of introducing something new
- Popper softens his position
	- Remove his initial motivation to hard demarcate science and non-science. Nonscientific ideas can be treated scientifically
Summary:
- Inescapability of confirmation. Popper is a view of what happens when we try to abandon confirmation
- Risk as a valuable attribute in science
