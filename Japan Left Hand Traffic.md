Along with the automobile traffic system being a left-handed, foot traffic is by cultural norms strongly enforced as left-handed as well. Signage in pedestrian-heavy areas like subway system and trains will generally direct pedestrians to stay on the left hand

Interestingly, I noticed tourist-heavy train stations like in Akihabara have signage to direct a right-handed system possibly to accommodate tourists
