A tax deduction reduces the taxable income amount. An RRSP is a tax deduction as it removes a portion of your income that would be taxed. 

A tax credit reduces the taxes you paid itself. They come in two flavours: refundable and non-refundable:
- refundable: reduces your tax and if reduces to 0, excess paid in cash
- non-refundable: if it reduces your tax to 0, any excess credits are not paid in cash. 
A note on the deceitful advertising in tax credits. The face value advertised may not be the actual amount that gets deducted. For example, when a bank advertises "5000$ tax credit on your first home" it is not saying they subtract $5000 from any taxes you pay that year. It is instead saying "we will give you back the taxes you paid on your first $5000" , or in other words, you're getting the face value at the appropriate marginalized tax rate. In this case, if the lowest marginal tax rate of that year was ~15%, you're only getting 15% of $5000 = $750 that gets reduced from your tax.

Tax deductions are therefore almost always preferable to tax credits as income earned in higher brackets are taxed more unless you're in the lowest income bracket in which case a tax credit has the same value as a tax deduction.

With the way tax credit works and the two flavous of tax credits, there are two things to understand in how it interacts with tax deductions:
- Deductions are applied first then any tax deductions of the refundable or non-refundable variety are applied. You must first determine how much you owe in tax before you can determine whether you get extra cash or wasted value from a refundable or non-refundable tax credit
- In looking at the value of a deduction vs a credit, a deduction takes away from your highest marginal rate while the tax credit starts at the lowest bracket.
