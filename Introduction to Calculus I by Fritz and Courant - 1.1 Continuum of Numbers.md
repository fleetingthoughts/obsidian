The chapter contains a review of the basic concepts for real analysis. The authors go over the following key concepts:
- Rational numbers
- An intuitive appeal to understand the denseness of Rational Numbers on the number line (yet to be defined)
- The existence of incommensurable quantities
- Demonstration of proof by contradiction
- A description of irrational numbers in terms of rational numbers.
Rational number written in the form $p/q$ where $p$ and $q\ne 0$ are integers. Further more, the rational operations (addition, multiplication, subtraction and division) are closed within the rational numbers, that is, any operation between rational numbers will produce rational numbers. This is not the case with natural numbers as 1-2 will not be a natural number.

The author demonstrates that rational numbers can be made arbitrarily close to any other number by making the denominator large enough. This ability to make the rational numbers arbitrarily close to ANY other number is expressed by saying: The rational numbers are dense on the number axis. Intuitively, density implies between any two points, there are infinitely many other points.
