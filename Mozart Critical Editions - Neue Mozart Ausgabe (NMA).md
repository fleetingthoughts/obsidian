The Barenreiter Urtext editions of Mozart are derived directly from the NMA which is the monumental de facto standard of the critical edition of Mozart's work. It is the 2nd complete works edition of Mozart and considered an advance over the previous complete works editions Breitkopf & Hartel (1877-1883) which is sometimes referred to as the Alte Mozart-Ausgabe ("Old Mozart Edition"). 

The NMA has been used by the Vienna Philharmonic

The **Neue Mozart Ausgabe** was originally published by Barenreiter from 1956-2007 and is now available [online](https://dme.mozarteum.at/DME/nma/nmapub_srch.php?l=2) as the Digital Mozart (DME) provided by the Internal Mozarteum Foundation. The default cataloguing option to filter by is the [[Kochel Catalogue (K.V) - Mozart]]
