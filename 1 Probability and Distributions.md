## 1.3 The Probability Set Function

We aim

***Definition 1.3.1*** Let $C$ be a sample space and let $B$ be the set of events. Let $P$ be a real-valued function defined on $B$. Then $P$ is a probability set if P satisfies the following 3 conditions
1. $P(A)\ge 0$ for all $A \in B$ 
2. $P(C) = 1$
3. if $\{A_n\}$ is a sequnce of events in $B$ and $A_m \cap A_n = \emptyset$ for all $m \ne n$, then $P(\cup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k = P(A_{n})$ 
We refer to a mutually exclusive and exhaustive collection of events of the sample space forms what's called a partition of the sample space

### 1.3.2 Additional properties of probability
***Theorem 1.3.7 (Boole's Inequality)***

***Remark 1.3.2 (Inclusion Exclusion Formula)***. There is a speciak case which givees the Bonferroni's inequality
