This chapter discusses the transformations of bivariate distributions that map the original random variables from $R^2 \to R$ resulting in a transformation to a univariate random variable but also those that map $R^2 -> R^2$ that transforms it to another bivariate distribution. The majority of this chapter is just in examples to show the mathematical techniques to find the pmf or CDF of the transformed random variable if we know the original bivariate distribution.
