The slip box should be like a shipping container. Focus on the objective of carrying ideas from beginning to end. 

How can we keep things simple, by not letting notes exceed critical mass. Avoid:
- making only fleeting notes
- taking notes on absolutely everything without going back and thinking about it and therefore organizing. Remember it is not organizing for the sake of organizing
- do not just make notes on ideas for a certain project. The slip box is an idea generator, how can you use the idea generator to store only specific information you already have ideas about? That's a backwards way of using it. [thinking is nonlinear and our repository should reflect that.](Ahren%20Chapter%207%20-%20thinking%20is%20nonlinear%20and%20our%20repository%20should%20reflect%20that..md)
