In this section, the author talks about how to place orders and some trading efficiencies.

Starting with placing orders, when entering a ticker symbol, you'll find the market price, the ask (the higher price to make a purchase) and the sell (the lower price when selling). The actual trade is never made at the market price, but rather at the bid or the ask if you're selling or buying.

Plan the amount of shares you need to buy with the money available. When placing non-fractional trades, you should round down to avoid over drafting the account. Additionally if you have commission costs, that must be subtracted first before making any trades. If you have $10,000 with typical trading costs of $9.95, then you really only have  ~ $9,990.

There different ways to place the buy order:
- Market order - not recommended compared to the other option
- Limit order - a cap that is placed on the order to minimize your risk. When buying, Bortolloti recommends putting in a penny (a)bove the (a)sk and a penny (b)elow the (b)id when selling. Market prices can jump in the span of seconds and a limit order can mitigate your risk here. 
Bortolloti recommends placing a limit order only during market hours as prices may jump unexpectedly when markets reopen. Note that placing a limit order does not mean you're necessarily paying the penny more. The order will still be executed at the best market price similar to a market order, but a limit order simply puts a cap with the tradeoff being that your order may take longer to fill. Limit orders are not to haggle a better price but to protect you.

By default, a day order is placed which means if a trade has not been executed by the time market closes, the order is withdrawn. Other options such as 30-60 day order options should be avoided.

One small detail to be aware of are settlement dates. When a sale is made, the seller is still the official owner of the shares for another two days even when the trade has been executed and the opposite is true when buying (the buyer will not be the official owner for another two days). The settlement date has consequences on stock dividend distributions as the official owner will be the one to receive it even if a sale has been made. As well, it has consequences on your liquidity. Executing a sale does not mean the cash is actually in your account yet and placing another order may result in you buying on margin.

Bortolloti provides additional tips on making efficient trades:
Trading commissions are incurred on every bulk trade and on each type of security. So it is advised to make large orders to reduce the impacts of trading commissions. This may not be viable if you're looking to make regular cash contributions at which point it may be worth building up the cash amount before trading
 
 The bid-ask spread means every single share bought results in a small amount of money lost as you'll always be buying some penny more and selling for a few pennies less. ETFs are better than individual stocks in [reducing the bid-ask spread](). At a high-level more trading volume reduces the bid-ask spread, but ETFs have a structure in place to align the price of the ETF security itself to the price of the underlying assets it represents, the NAV, with its [Authorized participants](ETF%20tax%20and%20trading%20efficiencies%20compared%20to%20actively%20managed%20mutual%20funds%20and%20index%20funds.md) who create or diminish the ETF supply to minimize the impacts large orders make on the price. With individual stocks, you may take a while to find a buyer/seller but ETFs will always have a seller/buyer in the form of an AP. Bortolloti makes the assumption here that the underlying stocks are traded in large volumes allowing the AP to fluctuate the supply, but that may not always be the case. It looks like the spread of the ETF is still dependent on the liquidity of the underlying assets?

The bid-ask spread is minimized by buying shares at a large price. As the spread is normally independent of the share price, if we assume the spread is relatively the same on ETFs tracking the same index, theoretically, buying an ETF at a larger price minimizes the impact of this spread. The downside is that it may leave a lot of uninvested cash if you're unable to make a fractional purchase and discount brokers may not have a fractional buy option for large share prices. 20-40$ is the sweet spot share price that funds found.

The time of day you place the trade also has some efficiencies. Never place your order when markets are closed as bid-ask spreads can be large at market open. ETF providers advise waiting 10-15 minutes after market open before placing traded. This includes holidays as well and it becomes complicated for funds holding foreign assets as foreign holidays mean those markets are closed and can impact the bid-ask spread. Pay attention to the spread, if it's large, there may be a holiday and you shouldn't place your trade.

On [Dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)](Dividend%20reinvestment%20plan%20(DRIP).md), no commissions are charged when using a DRIP, but the booking can be complicated for non-registered accounts, which is why DRIPs is recommended for TFSAs and RRSPs.

What about buying US-listed ETFs. US-listed ETFs generally have lower MERs ~0.16%, but there are foreign currency exchange fees to consider as well as the complicated [bookkeeping](Bookkeeping%20of%20ACB.md) as brokerages don't track the exchange rates on the day of purchase and you'll need to report a form T1135. There are [Foreign Withholding Tax](Foreign%20Withholding%20Tax.md)  efficiencies for RRSPs, but you don't need to buy US-listed ETFs to benefit from that. Simply buying ETFs in your domestic currency with an exposure to US equities in your RRSP will already leverage foreign withholding tax efficiencies.
