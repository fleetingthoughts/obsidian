### Calculus
- [_A Course of Pure Mathematics_ - G.H. Hardy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Course_of_Pure_Mathematics)
- [_Differential and Integral Calculus_- Richard Courant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Courant)
    - Apostol is more thorough but less discussion on applications when compared to [Fritz and Courant](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/63504/suggest-textbook-on-calculus). Apostol seems to be the more popular one among mathematicians
- _Analysis on Manifolds_ by James Munkres
	- More suited as a 2nd course in calculus per [Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1190170/munkres-analysis-on-manifolds-and-differential-geometry)
Advanced Multivariable Calculus reference request on [Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/44522/theoretical-multivariable-calculus-textbooks)
### Statistics and Probability
- _Statistical Inference_ - Casella and Berger
- _Introduction to Probability_- William Feller
	- Feller was one of the masters and pioneered the probability as a field in mathematics. [Remember Abel](Neils%20Heinrich%20Abel.md)
- _Probability Theory: A Comprehensive Course_ - Klenke
	- For Grad Students. Advanced per the preface
##### Meta Analysis
Only seen one [recommendation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/248311/which-is-the-best-book-to-learn-meta-analysis) and Hedges seems to appear a lot in meta analysis 
- _Statistical Methods for Meta Analysis_ - Olkin and Hedges
	- More theoretical of the two Hedges books
- Introduction to Meta Analysis - Borenstein and Hedges
	- The more practical of the two books
Should especially look to read applied statistics and read the father of statistics Ronald Fischer and George EP Box:
- _Design of Experiment_
	-  Introduced the Null hypothesis
- _Statistical Methods for Research Workers_
- _Statistics for Experimenters_ (2nd ed., 2005), 
- _Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control_
- _An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis_
- _**Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis**_
	-  Can be my first Bayesian statistics book
Seems to be one of the more mathemtical and classic treatments of multivariate statistics  per [Stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/67146/recommendations-for-mathematical-multivariate-statistics-with-exercises) But the preface does mention its for graduates

Statistics doesn't seem to generate much buzz with mathematicians, but here are some recommended advanced works after Casella from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_statistics)
- _Combinatorics of Experimental Design_ - Anne Street
	- Connects Statistics to combinatorics
[_Theory of statistics_](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/414/introduction-to-statistics-for-mathematicians)
### ODE
[[Rota's Criticism of Modern Pedagogy of Differential Equations]]
[Pretty representative summary of what I've seen for review of ODE books](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4119586/looking-for-a-2nd-book-on-ordinary-differential-equations). People really like Hirsch and Coddington. Should probably look at both
- _Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and Linear Algebra_ - Hirsch
- _Theory of ordinary differential equations_-Coddington
- _Ordinary Differential Equations_-Morris and Tennenbaum
- _Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes_- George Simmons
	- Per the preface, this is more of a graduate book as it presupposes some algebra, topology and real analysis and is not confident in recommending it for even senior undergraduates

### PDE
The following are easier books than Evans that were pretty [well regarded as an intermediate](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/72318/textbooks-for-pde-between-strauss-and-folland). Math StackExchange itself doesn't seem too keen on PDEs
- _Partial Differential Equations_ - Strauss
	- Very basic
- _Partial Differential Equations_ - John Fritz
	- Of calculus with Courant. I did like that particular textbook because of its applications. This is also a shorter book that I can easily dive into and compare to Strauss
-  _Partial Differential Equations_ - Laurence Evans
	- Advanced but highly regarded
### Discrete mathematics
- _Concrete Mathematics_ - Donald Knuth
### Real Analysis
Abbott, Rudin, and Folland are highly rated on [Stackexchange](Math.md#^0fdb2c). Abbott seems to be the better introduction
- _Understanding Analysis_ - Abbot
    -  A junior undergraduate book that's highly rated. Should read before Baby Rudin or Folland
- _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_ (Baby Rudin)
    - More of a senior book
- _Real analysis: Modern Techniques and their Application_- Folland
    + More of a senior book
### Complex Analysis
- _Complex Analysis_  Lars Ahlfors
	- Field medalist and one of the most highly rated books on Stackexchange
- _Complex Variables and its Applications_ - Churchill
	- Consensus on a alternative with more engineering applications per [Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/30749/what-is-a-good-complex-analysis-textbook-barring-ahlforss) 
- _Visual Complex Analysis_ - Tristan Needham
	- Geometric approach compared to classical approach to complex analysis
Another book I heard about was Conway that apparantly was written when [he was a student](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1384391/books-on-complex-analysis-ahlfors-conway-and-lang) and has some issues


### Number Theory
- _Introduction to the Theory of Numbers_ - Hardy
- _Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory_ by Ireland and Rosen
    - Review on relative difficulty of the books [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2313176/number-theory-book-recommendation)
    - [Some review on the pedagogical effectiveness](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/6074/differences-between-hardywright-and-irelandrosen-for-number-theory-course). Suggests that Rosen is more advanced. Apparantly it presupposes some [abstract algebra](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2558371/prerequisites-for-a-classical-introduction-to-modern-number-theory-by-rosen-an?rq=1)
### Algebra
- _Abstract Algebra_ - Dummit and Foote
    - highly regarded undergraduate book mentioned frequently [On StackExhange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/54839/good-abstract-algebra-books-for-self-study?noredirect=1&lq=1). Main criticisms is it is rather long and perhaps should be used more as a reference instead of as a primary text
The following seem more concise than Dummit and Foote
-  _First Course in Abstract Algebra_ - Fraleigh
	- Highly regarded on  [Stackexchange](Math.md#^0fdb2c)
- _A Book of Abstract Algebra_ - Pinter
	- Highly regarded on  [Stackexchange](Math.md#^0fdb2c)
- _Topics in Algebra_ - Herstein
	- [Seems like a better introductory book than Dummit and Foote due to being more concise](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/198373/choosing-an-abstract-algebra-text)
### Geometry
- _Foundations of Geometry_ - David Hilbert
	- One of the reformulations of Euclidean geometry on a modern axiomatic basis
### Topology
_Topology_ - Munkres
    - acknowledged as a good intro to the topic [here](Math#^84322d)
### Applied
- [_Methoden der mathematischen Physik __- Courant and Hilbert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoden_der_mathematischen_Physik)
### Linear Algebra and numerical methods
- [_Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers_-Richard Hamming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming)
- [_Linear Algebra_ - Gilbert Strang](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1040/which-linear-algebra-texts-should-i-read-before-learning-numerical-linear-algebr)
- [_Linear Algebra Done Right_-Axler Sheldon](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1040/which-linear-algebra-texts-should-i-read-before-learning-numerical-linear-algebr)
- _Linear Algebra_ - Friedberg and Insel
- _Linear Algebra_-Hoffman and Kunze 
     - this one is fairly advanced
- _Numerical linear algebra_ - Trefethen
    ### Numerical Methods
    - [_Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3__](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/Numerical_Methods_in_Engineering_with_Py.html?id=aJkXoxxoCoUC&redir_esc=y)
    - [_PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS: DATA WRANGLING WITH PANDAS, NUMPY, AND JUPYTER_ by Wes McKinney](https://pythonbooks.org/topical-books/numeric-and-big-data/)
    - _Coding The Matrix: Linear Algebra Through Computer Science Applications_
