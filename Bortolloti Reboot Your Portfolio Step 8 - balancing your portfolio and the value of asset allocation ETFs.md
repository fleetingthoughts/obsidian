The author briefly gives an overview of how to balance your portfolio and the different approaches, and the majority of the chapter is dedicated to an emotional appeal on simple one-fund solutions: asset allocation ETFs.

Assets will follow out of your target asset allocation as the yields will vary between all your assets. Equities may yield more than bonds and your portfolio will be overweight in equities, in which case more fixed-income assets need to be purchased.

How often should one balance? The author suggests three methods:
- Balancing by time interval. A common practice is to rebalance once every year, but consider rebalancing during the year start as companies typically make [Phantom Distributions at the end of the year](ETF%20Distributions%20and%20the%20impacts%20on%20ACB.md#^6d9d46) while making quarterly dividend distributions, so there is a small optimization to invest right at the beginning of the year to get those first dividend distributions and dodge 1 year of capital gains on phantom distributions with no year of yields. There are no conclusive research on whether balancing annually, quarterly, etc.. is advantageous.
- Balance by thresholds. Balancing when your portfolio falls out of your target tolerance. Bortolloti suggest rebalancing when allocation falls outside 5% tolerance for larget ~40/60% allocation and 2.5% tolerance for smaller 10/90% allocation.
- Balance with cash flows. Simply rebalancing everytime you input cash. Advantageous for people with portfolios small enough where the cash contribution will be a large portion of their portfolio.
There is of course no reason to only stick with one of the three and a combination can work.

Throughout the book, Bortolloti has talked about specific asset classes and described specific ETFs and the markets they represent and what ETFs you can purchase to obtain your target asset allocation. This was to give an understanding of the basics and the underlying mechanics, but instead of manually purchasing these portfolios, there are one-fund solutions that manage that asset allocation on your behalf. These one-fund solutions are called asset allocation ETFs. Asset allocation ETFs are "funds of funds". Vanguard's VBAL has a target asset allocation of 40% bonds and 60% stocks and holds seven other ETFs for example. They were first launched by Vanguard Canada in January 2018 with iShares and BMO shortly following suit. These ETFs have a slightly higher MER (~0.25%) and it can be argued there are some opportunity costs compared to buying individual ETFs due to trading and tax efficiencies, Some of the efficiencies you have by manually balancing your ETF portfolio include:
- Holding US-based equities in the RRSP to reduce [Foreign Withholding Tax](Foreign%20Withholding%20Tax.md)
- holding only Canadian based equities in non-registered account to avoid foreign withholding taxes
- It is recommended that TFSA accounts hold your assets of highest potential growth as there is no tax on withdrawal
Holding the same asset allocation in your account loses you all these tax efficiencies, but in my opinion, you can still take advantage of your TFSA by simply buy a 100% equity ETF in your TFSA while holding something else in your RRSP and non-registered account to obtain the target asset allocation.

Despite these tax efficiencies, Bortolloti argues that the effort to manually balance your portfolio is not worth the effort compared to these one-fund solutions. The biggest reason is because you are your own worst enemy. Forcing yourself to manually rebalance makes you vulnerable to analysis paralysis during times of economic downturn and you may not commit to your plan. Additionally the gain is typically very small with these tax efficiencies. Justin Bender had analyzed these tactics on historic returns and showed tax savings of just 0.1%.

The rest of the chapter is spent on an emotional appeal that just because the plan and portfolio is simple and all you're doing is buying one fund, it doesn't mean it's not effective. In fact, simplicty is a virtue and can save you from all the emotional pitfalls previously discussesd. Less complication and more automation lets you stick the plan.
