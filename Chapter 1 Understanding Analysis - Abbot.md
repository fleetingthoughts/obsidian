- We looked proof by contradiction using the irrationality of the square root of non-perfect squared integers as an example
- not a formal but general definition of what a field is and what an ordered field is: something you can apply the usual addition multiplication , commutative, associative and distributive property while having some sense of order to let you carry out inequality operations. More formal definition in Section 8
- Dirichlet introduced the formal definition of a function. This let him create his wonky Dirichlet functions
- Triangle inequality
- If and only if forward and backward meaning
- Proof by induction. Why is it a valid argumentative technique and its implications on natural numbers? for later. We'll return to Natural numbers after exploring R

1.3 Axiom of Completeness
