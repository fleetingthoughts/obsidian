Using the results we proved for sequences, we are now in a position to say something about an infinite series $\Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i$ . There are no new concepts here, as this section is effectly a collection of properties and tests for convergences for a series by applying theorems we already proved about sequences. I shall first present the theorems in the same order as the author before summarizing the "toolbox" we have at the end. At the end of the section, there is a new concept that we do learn about rearrangements

Question: Is there a way we can show the series converges to a limit if and only if the sequence of its partial sums converges to the same limit? How do we analytically connect the sequence of partial sums to the infinite series.
