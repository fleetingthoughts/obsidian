The act of placing an extremely large order relative to the trading volume of a security can impact the price. This impact in price from a large market order is referred to as a market impact and results in another cost on the buyer/seller. It is easy, for example to purchase 1 stock but harder to find other people to buy 1,000,000 stocks resulting you having to pay a premium to get it.
