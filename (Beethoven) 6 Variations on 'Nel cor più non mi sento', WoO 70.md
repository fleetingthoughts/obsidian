Variations based on a duet of the same name from Giovanni Paisiello _L'amor contrastato, ossia La molinara_ more commonly known as La Molinera. This is the 2nd variation from the [same opera that Beethoven wrote]((Beethoven)%209%20Variations%20on%20'Quant'%20é%20più%20bello,'%20WoO%2069.md) and were written around the same time during 1795. 

I choose this piece as I thought it would be representative of Beethoven's early works to practice as intermediate pieces as I work through his grander Pathetique and Moonlight Sonatas.
