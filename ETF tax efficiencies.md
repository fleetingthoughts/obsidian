The structure of the ETF where the ETF itself becomes a security provides it a loophole to minimize capital gains tax for the investor. Higher capitals gains occur when you sell a share that went up higher in price relative to when you bought it. When the ETF stock redemption occurs (issuer buys back their own security aka when investor sells the share), the fund has the flexibility to give away the stocks with the lowest purchase price and sell the stocks in the ETF with the highest price to minimize capital gains. 

The ETF redemption scenario of course only occurs if the market maker is unable to find another retail investor to purchase the security and avoids security and stock redemption all together. Hence ETFs benefit from more popularity and higher volumes to reduce the amount of times these redemption scenario occurs.

These tactics do nothing for dividends which will still be taxed at the designated rate (remember dividends tax rate is separate and typically lower than capital gains tax because the company already pays taxes on that revenue), but reinvesting the dividend lets you avoid the tax entirely.
