This chapter is divvied into three parts: 1) an intuitive appeal to the role and importance of science and the general questions we should be asking about it (which will be the central questions of the book) 2) What is the goal of the philosophy of science? 3) A brief survey on the possible answers to the role that science should play and what distinguishes science
## 1.2 The Scope of the Theory
PGS provides an intuitive appeal to the role and importance of science. The term science possesses immense "rhetorical" value as a valid form of investigation providing immediate justification to any claims. The role of science has come under fire and debate very recently in the "Science Wars".

We see that science is a form of investigation and this form of investigation has a special place in society and so in response to these sentiments, book poses two fundamental questions that will form the basis of the book:
1) How do we humans gain a understanding of the world around us?
2) What differentiates scientific investigation from other investigations?
# 1.3 What Kind of theory?
PGS aims to describe the role that the philosophy of science plays. In general, the philosophy of science is more closely related to epistemology but has less of a relationship, or at least PGS is hesitant about it, with metaphysics and so philosophy from those two fields will come up

The current body of work in the philosophy of science can be categorized as follows. Some books aim to gain an understanding of how "good" science has been conducted and understand what makes it good. But some works take a more proactive approach and aim to provide a <u>logical theory</u> to how science is conducted. Other works take the proactive approach more generally and aim to provide a general methodology for how science should be done. Overall there are two general approaches to the role that philosophy of science has played:
1) a descriptive role of understanding how scientific investigation has been done in the past
2) a normative role of making value judgements in how science <u>should </u>be done.
It will be useful to use these categories to assess the ideas in each chapter. My impression is that any good philosophy of science should be practical and provide guidance on how science should done, but these normative theories should conform with the good science done in the past that we have accepted into the community. In a sense, we are taking a "scientific" approach to the philosophy science which at a glance appears dangerously circular, but is an approach PGS takes with naturalism.

The role that metaphysics plays is briefly touched on in the idea of "objectivity". PGS impresses on the reader that the idea of objectivity implies the existence of a "true reality" that is independent of our minds and subjective thoughts.

In either the normative of descriptive role of the philosophy of science, PGS provides three different levels of science that will be explored in the book:
1) A "recipe" one should follow to do good science. Examples of this include the scientific method. I get the impression that this approach describes a methodology at the individual level. This is contrasted with 3)
2) an investigation at the abstract level, that is, logical theory and an attempt to reduce scientific investigation into logical relations of propositions
3) A strategy. This is the methodology of science at the organizational level and how the investigation should be done collaboratively. I interpret this approach as sociological and implies that scientific output is a whole that is greater than the sum of its individual parts. Contrast this kind of description against 1)

# 1.4 Three Answers or Pieces of an Answer
PGS tentatively provides three possible solutions to how science has worked and should worked:
### Empiricism
Science has and can only be done through everyday experience, and to perform science successfully is to be organized and systematic in the way that we collate this experience. Here PGS appeals to historic examples such as Ignaz Semmelweiss' washing of the hands, John Snow's empirical investigation of cholera and the way John organized the data formed the basis of epidemiology. In a sense the empirical approach to science is like a "recipe" and that science is ultimately at the individual level which will be contrasted against the more sociological views of science. But he also warns of the unreliability of experience citing Pettenkofer's rebuttal of the germ theory and so the problem of confirmation will come up in Empiricism.

## Logic and Math
Science is characterized by the abstract tools it uses namely math and logic. This view was championed by Galileo. Science in this way is characterized by its ability to be quantitative, but this puts into question the role of biological work such as that done by Darwin into question. While Darwin's work is largely qualitative, it can be argued that it formed the basis of the eventual quantitative work now established in molecular biology.

## Social structure
Here Science is characterized as a special kind of organization or collaboration between individuals. This kind of organization and collaboration transcends time as well in that present scientists stand on the shoulders of past giants before them. This approach to science can be contrasted against the empirical approach to science which qualifies good science by what the individual does and not necessarily how they collaborate with other works. In a sense, empiricism can be seen as being distrustful of other established works or social structures and asks the individual to constantly challenge it. The examples brought up in the empiricism section align with the romantic image of the individual persevering in the face of opposition, but it is worth noting that those people ultimately had to collaborate and trust the data collected by others. John Snow ultimately relied on epidemiological data provided by others, and so, science is perhaps a system of data and information that we can trust. This sociological view of science as a whole greater than the sum of its parts, recontextualizes past scientific achievements such as the scientific revolution when we note that institutions such as the Royal society of London were established and made more efficient the exchange of data and ideas.
