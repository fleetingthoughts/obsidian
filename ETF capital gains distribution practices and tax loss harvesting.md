Funds only makes capital gains distributions in December and the entire fund is on the hook for it equally. This capital gains can come in the form of  [cash distribution or an capital gains tax distribution that adjusts your ACB](ETF%20Taxable%20events%20and%20the%20impacts%20on%20ACB.md). Theoretically this means if you join a fund at the end of the year, you can be joining an ETF right when these distributions are made that one-time in the year without experiencing the growth of that year. It'll be like someone coming to dinner late and then still having to pay for the full meal despite not being able to eat much. But in the long-term, this should not matter if you stay in the fund for a long time as it only means there was 1 year that you paid extra on capital gains without experiencing any of its growth.
