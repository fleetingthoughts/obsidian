We have an <u>upper bound</u> for any sum of absolute value terms by the triangular inequality:
$$|a+b|\le|a|+|b|$$
Other forms of the triangular inequality can result from subtraction as well:
$$|a-b|\le |a|+|-b| = |a|+|b|$$

We can also prove case-by-case that a <u>lower bound</u> (or deriving it from the triangular inequality) can be found for the absolute value of sums using the so-called "reverse triangular inequality":
$$|a| - |b| \le |a+b|$$ and similarly for the absolute value of the differences:
$$|a| - |b| \le |a-b|$$
