There are two different formulae for the sum of squares. One is just a direct formula while another provides a more interesting geometric interpretation. The direct formula is as follows:$$1^2+2^3+3^3+...+n^3=(\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2$$
Another formula for the sum of squares is [Nicomachus's Theorem](Nicomachus's%20Theorem.md)
