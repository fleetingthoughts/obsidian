The Alessandro Longo edition was one of the first compilation of Scarlatti's keyboard works and first attempt to [catalogue his work](Cataloguing%20of%20Scarlatti.md). 

This edition by Ricordi has been superseded by the Emilia Fadini edition published by Ricordi as well, but the Fadini edition follows the urtext philosophy of philological faithfulness and "authenticity" to the composer and is therefore free of any performance or interpretive suggestions.

This Longo edition of Scarlatti contains many interpretive and aesthetic suggestions such as fingerings and the the sonatas have been grouped as 5 into suites offering the insights from the trained composer and performer Alessandro Longo
