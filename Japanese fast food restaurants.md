Common fast food chains are beef bowls places like Sukiya and Nakau. These restaurants commonly have self-serve machines and offer <1000¥ options although I rarely ended up satisfied with those cheaper (i.e. smaller) meal options. They serve as cheap functional meals for the working-class. During my 2nd Japan trip, I enjoyed a large curry rice option while my friends enjoyed the more typical beef bowl options.
