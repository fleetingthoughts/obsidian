The slip box
- temporary notes
- literature notes with rewording and references
- convert to permanent notes by linking to existing ideas and expanding on the context
the next steps are more relevant for creation

The system needs to be easily referenced and accessed (you going to check dense books)?

- the slip box app for actual notes (obsidian)
- the editor (markdown files notepad)

Remember it is only the scaffold to facilitate ideas. It should be fast and easy to document

It is your personal research and your notes is your research paper. This is your tangible objective when studying: to create a paper. In this sense writing IS the goal a tangible goal that facilitates thinking.
