Motivation is critical for continued work and continued feedback is a way for us to receive that motivation. Writing and rewording notes in the margin of a book we are reading is an example of this positive feedback loop: we are testing our ability to understand the information we just read.  

Generating this motivation is one side of the equation, we need a feedback system to generate a positive feedback loop of motivation. The slip box and creation of permanent notes is a way of constantly testing our understanding of the material and providing us such feedback.
