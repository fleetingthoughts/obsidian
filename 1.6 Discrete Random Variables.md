First defining a discrete random variable

***Definition 1.6.1 (Discrete Random Variable)***. We say a random variable is a discrete random variable if its space is either finite or countable. ^def-1-6-1

***Definition 1.6.2 (Probability Mass function (pmf)).*** Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with space $D$, then the probability mass function (pmf) of $X$ is given by:
$$p_X(x) = P(X=x)$$
Note that by the properties of probability functions, it must satisify the two properties:
1) $0 \le p_X(x) \le 1$ 
2) $\sum_{x \in D}p_X(x) = 1$ 
3) 
Outside the scope of this book, but more advanced techniques can show that if a function satisfies the above two properties for a discrete set $D$  then this function can uniquely determine the distribution of the random variable.

The <u>support</u> of the discrete random variable is defined as the $x \in X$ such that $P(x) \gt 0$ or basically the set of real numbers that actually matter and have a chance of occuring.
