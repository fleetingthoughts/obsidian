First defining a discrete random variable

***Definition 1.6.1 (Discrete Random Variable)***. We say a random variable is a discrete random variable if its space is either finite or countable

Outside the scope of this book, but more advanced techniques can show that the pmf of a discrete random variable can uniquely determine the distribution of the random variable.

The <u>support</u> of the discrete random variable is defined as the $x \in X$ such that $P(x) \gt 0$ or basically the set of real numbers that actually matter and have a chance of occuring.
