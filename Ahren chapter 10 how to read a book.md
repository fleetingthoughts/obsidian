In the same vein as Adler.
10.1. read with a goal in mind to promote understanding. The zettalkasten encourages two goals creating connections with existing notes and creating permanent notes. Also read with a pencil in hand, there seem to be lots of studies supporting that handwritten notes promote more understanding, but have no impact on retention.
10.2 using zettalkasten to address confirmation bias. Traditional writing methods promote planning and generation of a hypothesis as the first step, this promotes bias as we try to fit increase into literal categories or presumptions we came up first. Leverage zettalkasten to agnostically record information by focusing on the linking of ideas with existing notes. The ideas that contradict our existing notes will generate the most discussion and make for easy linking.
10.3 note taking with concise notes with the goal of separating the main point from the fluff
10.4 reading with the goal to rewrite helps us understand the main point better. As Feynman said, "I do not understand it unless I can give an introductory lecture".
10.5 10.3 and 10.4 seem like a waste of time and we can rely on secondary sources instead that can do all this for us. "Why read physics texts when Feynman can summarize it better for us", but 10.3 and 10.4 is the very act of learning and elaboration. It is not note taking for the sake of note taking it is learning itself. As opposed to traditional methods of making annotations to re-review later. Luhrmann almost never read the same work twice
