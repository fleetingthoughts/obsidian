10.1. read with a goal in mind to promote understanding. The zettalkasten encourages two goals creating connections with existing notes and creating permanent notes. Also read with a pencil in hand, there seem to be lots of studies supporting that handwritten notes promote more understanding, but have no impact on retention.
10.2 using zettalkasten to address confirmation bias. Traditional writing methods promote planning and generation of a hypothesis as the first step, this promotes bias as we try to fit increase into literal categories or presumptions we came up first.

The ideas that contradict our existing notes will generate the most discussion and make for easy linking.
