Tax loss harvesting is the reduction of capital gains tax by selling intentionally for a realized loss to offset realized gains to reduce taxes at the moment you sell. This lets you essentially re-invest your capital gains tax and defer the tax. Note that this is a deferral and not a cancellation of your tax as the tax saving will eventually become taxable when you liquidate the replacement investments.

You can then spend the tax deductible on another stock that you expect to appreciate in value and perform better than the stock you just sold. Note that you cannot buy back the stock you sold for 30 days as that would be an illegal wash sale. Otherwise, you'd be able to just buyback the stock you just sold and buy more with your tax savings and cheat the system. Your loss would be called a "superficial loss" which you cannot use as a [tax deduction](Tax%20deduction%20vs%20Tax%20credit.md) for 30 days. The tradeoff is if if the stock ever goes up, you obviously realized a loss that would have been a gain, but you also pay more in capital gains compared to not realizing the loss as the realized loss reduced your ACB. 

For retail investors, the CRA lets you carry capital losses back 3 years, that is if you had any capital gains in the past 3 years, you can realize a loss to regain what you had paid in tax, letting you put your taxed money back to work. But remember, you can't use the money from your sale plus the tax credit to then just buy back the original stock or it is a wash sale in which case it would be a wash sale

But while the buyback of individual stocks can be deemed a superficial loss using tax loss harvesting, the strategy can really be leveraged with index ETFs to avoid wash sales. As long as you buy a different index that has the same or similar market exposure, it is still effectively the same ETF. Say hypothetically you have stock that has an unrealized loss that you hold and you expect to appreciate in price (no rational investor would hold a stock they expect to go bankrupt), you can realise that loss to offset any gains and then immediately buy back the stock you believed in, but unfortunately that is an illegal wash sale. But applied to index funds, instead of illegally buying back the stock, you can instead buy a different index fund that has the same underlying assets. In fact this is what fund managers do frequently to minimize [capital gains distribution](ETF%20Distributions%20and%20the%20impacts%20on%20ACB.md). But you need to be careful as the CRA has issued a [bulletin](https://taxinterpretations.com/cra/severed-letters/2001-0080385) where different ETFs can be considered "identical" so your capital loss will be considered a wash sale and cannot offset any gains. As the same with tax loss harvesting on individual stocks, the tradeoff is if if the ETF ever goes up, you obviously realized a loss that would have been a gain, but you also pay more in capital gains compared to not realizing the loss as the realized loss reduced your ACB. So this tactic makes sense if the tax savings + the growth of the new ETF you buy out weighs the capital gains on the decrement of the ACB and the opportunity cost in the growth of the asset you just sold. If the new ETF you bought tracks the same index then the growth of the new ETF should be comparable to the old ETF, and so what remains is that the growth of the tax savings must exceed the eventual taxable event when we eventually withdraw and incur capital gains which should happen if you hold onto the ETF for a long amount of time.

The strategy can go one step further and take advantage of the fact that equities held for varying lengths are taxed at different rates depending on your income. Equities held for a longer time and sold are taxed less to encourage more investors, while shorter held equities are taxed higher. In other words, short terms gains are taxed higher than long-term gains. This becomes useful for a fund that holds the same stock of varying holding periods where you can offset the gains of short-term capital gains with long-term capital losses. In this case, you're reducing the tax paid and deferring it. You can also employ the same tactic if you expect to be at a lower income bracket in the future so that you defer your loss to a more preferable tax bracket. Also as the capital gains tax rate is dependent on your marginal income, you can also carry back capital losses to years when you had high income. ^2114c8

In summary, tax loss harvesting makes sense when:
1) You had past or current investments subject to capital gains
2) You can defer the tax until the long term so you put the tax saving to work for a long time to outweight the potential loss from your sold asset appreciating in value and incurring capital gains on your reduced ACB
3) Your tax bracket is changing. 
4) You invest in individual stocks.

Tax loss harvesting has no use in tax-sheltered accounts, but in non-registered accounts, but in non-registered accounts, it lets you reclaim losses in capital gains tax from [phantom distributions](ETF%20Distributions%20and%20the%20impacts%20on%20ACB.md#^6d9d46). 

Mathematically, say you got capital distribution from phantom distributions, the impact on your ACB and the cash that you would reinvest like a smart Boglehead would be:

ACB:  ACB - distribution
reinvested amount: (Sale-ACB) - (Sale-ACB)(capital gains tax)


The yield you got from (Sale - ACB) - (Sale-ACB)(capital gains)
