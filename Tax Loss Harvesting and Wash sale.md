Tax loss harvesting is the reduction of capital gains tax by selling intentionally for a realized loss to offset realized gains to reduce taxes at the moment you sell. This keeps let you keep more of your money at work for longer and makes it more tax efficient. Useful for when you're looking to make withdrawals for cash for retirement if for whatever reason you have short-term capital losses, but for most people they're looking to continuously looking to put your money to work so where do you put that money you saved on taxes? The tradeoff is that because you made losses on your short-term holdings, it reduces the ACB increasing potential capital gains if the stock ever goes up, the premise being that no reasonable investor holds a stock expecting it to go down. In this way, you're not really cancelling taxes, but deferring it.

The strategy can go one step further and take advantage of the fact that equities held for varying lengths are taxed at different rates depending on your income. Equities held for a longer time and sold are taxed less to encourage more investors, while shorter held equities are taxed higher. In other words, short terms gains are taxed higher than long-term gains. This becomes useful for a fund that holds the same stock of varying holding periods where you can offset the gains of short-term capital gains with long-term capital gains. Similarly with this, you're deferring the tax rather than cancelling it entirely with again the premise being that all the stocks you hold are expected to appreciate in price.


The idea is then to use the short-term realized gains that will be taxed higher, you can deduct from that with long-term realized that would be taxed less if they become gains.
