A review of some fundamentals for real analysis. The relevant concepts that this chapter goes over:
- monotonic functions and one-to-one mapping
- Even functions $f(-x)=f(x)$
- Odd Functions: $f(-x)=-f(x)$
- Continuity of $f(x)$ at $x_o$ formulated as follows: for any arbitrary $\epsilon$-neighborhood $J$ of point $y_0=f(x_0)$ (i.e. the interval $(y_o-\epsilon, y_o+\epsilon)$), we can find a $\delta$-neighborhood of $x$ that entirely maps to $J$. 
- Modulus of continuity
	- Uniformly continuous and uniform modulus of continuity.
	- Lipschitz-Continuous
	- Holder Continuous
- Intermediate Value Theorem
- Conditions for the continuity of inverse functions

Vague expressions like "arbitrarily small" are now replaced with more specific formulations like "for any positive value".
