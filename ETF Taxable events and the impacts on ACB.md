When an investor sells their ETF, the fund is allocated as a taxable event to the other fund owners. How the gains/loss is distributed affects your ACB differently. If the capital gain is distributed as cash, then it is like a dividend and there is no impact on your ACB. If the capital gain is reinvested in the fund to purchase more shares for example, the fund essentially made income even though it spent it on more shares and that capital gains is paid by the fund owners. This results in an adjustment in the ACB. to avoid double taxing when you eventually sell the ETF. Example

ACB of $10,000 -> ETF fund makes capital gains of $500 -> you pay the capital gains -> ACB = 10,000+500=10,500.
