When a fund manager sells the underlying stocks, the fund can be allocated as a taxable event to the other fund owners and the capital gains can be distributed in different ways. How the gains/loss is distributed affects your ACB differently. If the capital gain is distributed as cash, then it is treated like a regular capital gain. If the capital gains is returned as an ROC, then it adjusts your ACB down. If the capital gain is reinvested in the fund to purchase more shares for example, the fund essentially made income even though it spent it on more shares and that capital gains is paid by the fund owners. This results in an adjustment in the ACB. to avoid double taxing when you eventually sell the ETF. Example

ACB of $10,000 -> ETF fund makes capital gains of $500 -> you pay the capital gains -> ACB = 10,000+500=10,500. 

The ACB goes up to minimize the difference when you eventually sell your entire holding. 

The reinvesting of the capital gains back into the fund resulting in capital gains tax on the owners is referred to as a Phantom Distribution. It's referred to as such because capital gains usually results in some kind of cash distribution to the original investor, but it doesn't in this case as the cash only passed hands briefly with the fund manager before being reinvested. The ACB still needs to be adjusted accordingly as the capital gains is distributed to the fund owners. This can result from stocks being sold after being deleted from the fund's benchmark index which happened following an increase in price as it did with [iShares](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/11/17/1043703/0/en/BlackRock-R-Canada-Announces-Estimated-2016-Annual-Reinvested-Capital-Gains-Distributions-for-the-iShares-R-ETFs.html).  This may be a reason why [indexes that look at "undervalued" stocks](Chapter%205%20Selecting%20the%20appropriate%20index%20ETF.md#^9854d8) can result in high capital gains as it is self-defeating in that if a company appreciates in value, it falls out of the index and you're hooked with the capital gains. ^6d9d46

From my understanding, Dividends tax on domestic equities that avoid any [Foreign Withholding Tax](Foreign%20Withholding%20Tax.md) are lower than capital gains tax typically so Phantom Distributions may be less preferable than a cash payout. 

ACB calculation can get quite complicated and there are some [guidelines to simplify the accounting of the ACB](Bookkeeping%20of%20ACB.md).
