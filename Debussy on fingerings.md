Debussy in the first edition of his  ***Étude*** quotes "I intentionally do not mention any fingerings". "Cherchons nos doigtes". 

It is not known whether this sentiment extends to his other works, but urtext editions at least of Debussy's etudes should not have any fingerings and echoes the sentiment that fingerings are deeply personal. They are like shoes: no one shoe fits everyone.
