The section illustrates examples of where standard algebraic manipulations of addition, multiplication, etc.. of an infinite series can lead to contradictory results. This puts into question the validity of these operations on infinite objects.

Consider for example the series of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n$ which we assume must equal some finite quantity $S$. Adding two copies of the summation together can lead to two different groupings. One particular grouping yields 0:
$$S+S=(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+.... = 0+0+0+...=0$$
Whereas another grouping yields an entirely different result:
$$S+S=-1+(1-1)+(1-1)+.... = -1 +0+0+0+...=-1S$$
Manipulations that are legitimate in finite settings, do not always extend to infinite settings. In these chapters we show the criteria required for us to algebraically manipulate the sums of these infinite series, namely convergence and the limit.
