Now we arrive at the formalization of mathematics summarizing the work done by the following people:
- Augustin Louis Cauchy
- Berhard Bolzano
- Niels Henrick Abel
- Peter Lejeune Dirichlet
- Karl Weiesrstrass
- Bernhard Riemann
Each of these people help provide a more concrete definitions and axioms from which we can formulate the mathematical concepts that were informally developed previously such as the majority of calculus from the "infinitesimally small" quantities from Newton and Leibnitz's time

We assume that $R$ is an ordered field which contains $Q$ as a subfield (until explored in section 8). This lets us perform the basic algebraic and inequality math on any elements within the set. We now formulate the Axiom of Completeness (AoC)

***Axiom of Completeness***. **Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded has a least upper bound**

To develop some understanding of this. We first need to understand what the least upper bound is which is also referred to as the supremum:

***Definition 1.3.1***. A set $A$ $\subseteq$
