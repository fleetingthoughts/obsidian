The chapter begins with an experimental motivation to look at mathematical objects that describe physical quantities (e.g. force and velocity) that care about two quantities: magnitude and direction. These mathematical objects are vectors. Note that starting position is not considered.

These experimental motivation go on further to describe geometrically vectors can be added following a parallelogram law:

This geometric view looks at vector addition as a tail-to-head construction where one vector originates from the endpoint of another vector that starts from the origin.

Another view is to describe this geometry "analytically" by the endpoint of each vector originating from the origin. We can fully describe a vector's magnitude and direction by this endpoint, say $(x_1,y_2)$ and so given two vectors described this way by their endpoints $(x_1,x_2)$ and $(y_1,y_2)$, then the sum of the vectors is simply $$(x_{1}+y_{1},x_{2}+y_{2})$$
We are further experimentally motivated to describe parallel vectors by the fact if they only differ in magnitude but go in the same direction so that their ratio is simply a scalar.

These descriptions let us set up the following axioms to describe vectors $x$, $y$, $z$:
1) $x+y$ =
