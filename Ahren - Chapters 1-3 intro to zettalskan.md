The slip box
- temporary notes
- literature notes with rewording and references
- convert to permanent notes by linking to existing ideas and expanding on the context
the next steps are more relevant for creation

The system needs to be easily referenced and accessed (you going to check dense books)?
- develop a reference management system for citations. I e. Zotero
- the slip box app for actual notes (obsidian)
- the editor (markdown files notepad)

Remember it is only the scaffold to facilitate ideas. It should be fast and easy to document
