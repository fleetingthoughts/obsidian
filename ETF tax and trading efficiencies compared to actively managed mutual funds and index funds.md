ETFs and mutual funds share similar tax efficiency tactics, but ETFs can further reduce taxable events.

The resource pool structure of the mutual fund and ETF structure itself as a security provides it an advantage to minimize capital gains tax for the investor. Higher capitals gains occur when you sell a share that went up higher in price relative to when you bought it. When a fund stock redemption occurs (issuer buys back their own security aka when investor sells the share), the fund has the flexibility to give away the stocks with the lowest purchase price and sell the stocks in the fund with the highest price to minimize capital gains. 

Generally index ETFs inherently reduce [taxable events](ETF%20Taxable%20events%20and%20the%20impacts%20on%20ACB.md) by not actively managing them. Compared to their index mutual fund counterparts, the ETF can further reduce taxable events as the ETF is a security itself that can be traded with other investors shielding the fund itself from having to meet investor withdrawals. The creation of a bundle of stocks (aka an ETF) is referred to as a creation unit. The term creation unit emphasizes how there is another middle-man between the ETF itself and the trading of the underlying assets that can shield the ETF from capital gains unlike mutual funds which have to directly deal with the underlying assets sometimes.  The ETF redemption scenario of course only occurs if the market maker is unable to find another retail investor to purchase the security and avoids security and stock redemption all together. Hence ETFs benefit from more popularity and higher volumes to reduce the amount of times these redemption scenario occurs. So this further reduces taxable events for the investor where it minimizes in-fund trading

Only certain authorized dealers (also called authorized participants or AP) can redeem ETF units directly and the ETF is redeemed by "in-kind" redemption transactions (i.e. trading security ETF for security stocks). With "in-kind" transactions, the AP is the one that shoulders the trading costs and capital gains cost of the underlying asset. Although transactions with cash do occur and the investor must look for that in the capital gains tax.


These tactics do nothing for dividends which will still be taxed at the designated rate (remember dividends tax rate is separate and typically lower than capital gains tax because the company already pays taxes on that revenue), but reinvesting the dividend lets you avoid the tax entirely.
