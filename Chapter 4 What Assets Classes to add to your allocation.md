After the previous chapter discussing what asset allocation you should choose that aligns with your risk tolerance and your financial plans, we now look at the asset classes that one should include in their portfolio.

He provides a brief overview of the equity classes and the reasoning why they should be included:
1) U.S equity
2) International Equity
3) Emerging Equity
4) Canadian Equity

U.S equity has a negative correlation with the rest of the market and they are also the largest chunk of the global market. The US currency is considered the save haven that everyone flocks too when the rest of the financial market  crumbles. International and emerging markets are just for more global exposure. 

Bortolloti argues that a Canadian portfolio should be overweighted in the Canadian market relative to its global market share. Vanguard research has shown that although the Canadian market makes up for ~3% of the global market, portfolios with 20-40% Canadian stocks had less volatility (Investment Funds Institute of Canada). There is a more practical reason for a Canadian investor to allocate more to Canadian stocks: Canadian Index funds are often ~0.2% less in fees and dividends from foreign stocks are subject to [[Foreign Withholding Tax]] even in tax-sheltered accounts like the TFSA and RRSP.
