There are 4 different catalogue numberings of Domenico Scarlatti's works:
- [Ralph Leonard Kirkpatrick](Ralph%20Leonard%20Kirkpatrick.md) catalogue (denoted K.). Based on perceived chronological ordering of the sonatas from the records in Venice as opposed to Parma
- Alessandro Longo catalogue (denoted L.) for the numbering based on his complete 10-volume work of Scarlatti where 5 sonatas at a time were arranged in suites
- Emilia Fadini catalogue
- Giorgo Pestelli numbering
