There are 4 different catalogue numberings of Domenico Scarlatti's works:
- [Ralph Leonard Kirkpatrick](Ralph%20Leonard%20Kirkpatrick.md) catalogue (denoted K.). Based on perceived chronological ordering of the sonatas from the records in Venice as opposed to Parma
- Alessandro Longo catalogue (denoted L.) for the numbering based on his complete [[(Scarlatti) Opere Complete Per Clavicembalo In 10 Volumi E Un Supplemento]] where 5 sonatas at a time were arranged in suites. These editions contained several editorial suggestions and fingerings which I think have merit as an interpretive edition
- Emilia Fadini catalogue. The numbering follows the work published the same Ricordi company that published Alessandro Longo's work, but follows the urtext "composer's intentions" and eliminates and interpretive editorial suggestions found in Alesssandro Longo's work thus rendering it a true critical urtext edition as opposed to a interpretive edition
There are other Scarlatti cataloguing systems that are not commonly used, but these above are commonly used.
