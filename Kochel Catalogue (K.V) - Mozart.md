Originally in German as the Kochel-Verzeichnis (abbreviated as K. or K.V. ). It is the catalogue of the compositions by Mozart originally created by Musicologist Ludwig Ritter von Kochel and is an ongoing task to compile the chronology of Mozart's works. The catalogue was originally meant to be in chronological order but several revisions had to be made.

The Piano Sonata No. 16 in C Major (Sonata Fascile) for example is catalogued as K. 545.
