In this section we define another function that uniquely characterizes a pdf or pmf and how this "characterizing" function can generate some well known properties of the pdf or pmf like the mean and the variance even if we don't know what the pmf or pdf could be.

We first define some of these properties called the "moments about a number" of a random variable $X$ . The expectation is actually one of these properties that can be generated by the "characterizing function" that we'll describer later in this chapter:
