This chapter is a miscellaneous chapter that can be treated as an "appendix", but it will be a collection of inequalities (mathematical tools) that are applicable to statistics

We will first prove a theorem that establishes the existence of momentum-generating function once we establish the existence of a different one

***Theorem 1.10.1 (Existence of momentum-generating function)***. Let $X$ be a random variable and $m$ be a positive integer. If $E[X^m]$ exists, then for $k \le m$, $E[X^k]$ exists as well.

The proof is for the continuous case but is analagous to the discrete case

***Theorem 1.10.2 (Markov's Inequality).*** Let $u(X)$ be a nonnegative function of the random variable $X$. If $E[u(X)]$ exists, then for every positive constant $c$.
