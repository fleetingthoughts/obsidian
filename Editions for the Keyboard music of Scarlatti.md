The following summarizes the music editions that are both well-regarded whether as an urtext critical edition or an interpretive edition by myself. It should be noted that these works also constitute comprehensive catalogues of Scarlatti's works, and so, the conceit of the various Scarlatti cataloguing systems were from these works.
- Emilia Fadini edition (Ricordi). 10 volumes partially edited by the harpsichordist performer Emilia Fadini, this edition is based on the original Ricordi catalogue of Scarlatti's works edited by Alessandro Longo but follows the traditional urtext philosophy and so any interpretive edits are absent. Emilia Fadini was not able to complete the 10 volumes before her death and so the last two volumes were only partially edited by her.
- [Alessandro edition](Scarlatti%20Opere%20Complete%20Per%20Clavicembalo%20In%2010%20Volumi%20E%20Un%20Supplemento.md) (Ricordi). The original 10 volume comprehensive catalogue of Scarlatti's keyboard works published by Ricordi. The edition can be considered an interpretive edition given the fingerings and aesthetic choices made by Longo. For instance, an aesthetic choice was made to group the sonatas under a suite in groups of 5.
- Ralph Kirkpatrick edition (Schirmer). Kirkpatrick's numbering system is based on chronological order. Kirkpatrick has only edited 60 Scarlatti Sonatas.
- [Kenneth Gilbert (Heugel)](Sonatas%20for%20Clavier%20(10%20Volumes).md) Part of the Le Pupitre series of works. This edition contains the complete keyboard sonatas of Scarlatti and is considered an urtext version. Based on the Venetian facsimiles that Ralph Kirkpatrick also based his work on, this edition also follows the Kirkpatrick numbering
