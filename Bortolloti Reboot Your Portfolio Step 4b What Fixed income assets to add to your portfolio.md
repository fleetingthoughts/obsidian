Throughout the discussion of fixed income assets, it is emphasized that the purpose of adding these asset classes to the mix is to reduce volatility, and so, any asset classes that increase volatility will not align with the objectives despite higher yields. A higher portion of equity asset classes should be considered if we are looking at high-yield high-risk fixed income assets. ^d59b28

Bortolotti also discusses what fixed income assets (i.e. bonds) should be included in your portfolio. He argues that investment-grade (small chance of default) bonds of two different flavors should be included in your portfolio:
- Government bonds 
- Corporate bonds
A broad market index fund will generally hold bonds of both types with varying maturity dates (longer maturity date = higher yields).

It is argued that only Canadian bonds should be held. This runs counter to the diversification principles of [equity assets](Bortolloti%20Reboot%20Your%20Portfolio%20Step%204a%20What%20Equity%20Assets%20Classes%20to%20add%20to%20your%20allocation.md). Foreign bonds introduce a currency risk where a foreign bond may rise in price but the Canadian dollar may plummet relative to that country's currency adding additional  [risk the investor is not looking for from fixed income assets](Bortolloti%20Reboot%20Your%20Portfolio%20Step%204b%20What%20Fixed%20income%20assets%20to%20add%20to%20your%20portfolio.md#^d59b28). These bonds are also subject to [Foreign Withholding Tax](Foreign%20Withholding%20Tax.md), and so may be tax inefficient ^d06605

The value of [GIC](GICs%20vs%20Bonds.md) are also discussed. GICs are generally illiquid, but have much more stability that is irresponsive to rising interest rates. They should be used if there is a fixed amount of money you expect to spend in the future with certainty, such as a downpayment, school, etc..

Background history: government bonds used to have high 6-8% returns.
