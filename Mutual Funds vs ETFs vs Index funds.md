My remaining questions: How does an ETF generate its money, on MERs? Then why do the security holders pay that MER. Is an ETF a bet on a index fund that you do not directly partake in? Then why do you pay the MER?

All Index funds are mutual funds but not vice-versa. Mutual funds predate any kind of financial regulation and are a way for people to pool money together to buy collections of stocks conveniently during a time when the barrier of entry to the stock market was so high. Index funds are just mutual funds that track an index and as a result have lower MERs because they are not actively managed in anyway. Index funds just follow a formula and have lower operating costs as a result

What's the distinction with ETFs? ETFs are a form of Exchange-traded products. They are actual products that can be exchanged on the stock exchange. ETFs are effectively mutual funds that can be traded like stock. As a result, they leverage the securities exchange infrastructure and can make it more accessible for people. You can usually transfer ETF from one broker to another while brokers don't necessarily have access to all the mutual funds. Additionally the fact that the bundle of stocks, the ETF itself, is a security lets it act as a buffer for the fund manager to redistribute and fandangle before actually dealing with the underlying stocks and the secondary market. Effectively, the ETF can fluctuate its own security supply, unlike individual stocks which have a finite supply initially issued in the IPO

ETFs have no 12b1 fees more tax efficient due to their [share redemption process](ETF tax efficiencies).  in the US and can be traded throughout the day. Mutual funds HAVE the 12b1 fees and orders can only be placed after market hours. Mutual fund managers may make realized capital gains causing all their shareholders to pay a capital gains tax. ETFs can be held like a stock. **12b1 fee** named after a section of the 1940 Investment act which let mutual funds market their funds the rationale being that it was better for the investor that the fund be marketed as more contributions are made.

ETFs are traded just like stocks so they are subject to the transaction fees of your national security exchange (such as US exchanges must pay a small amount to the SEC per the SEC act of 1934) while mutual funds can be bought commission-free but some may come with [loads](Commission%20types.md)  (but they still come with heft MERs)

Why the distinction? The rationale is that ETFs are better in efficient markets and mutual funds are better in inefficient markets.

The popular ETFs are Index ETFs. ETFs are an umbrella term that include Index ETFs (aka index funds) that mirrors the asset allocation of a market index.
