## Structure
My remaining questions: How does an ETF generate its money, on MERs? Then why do the security holders pay that MER. Is an ETF a bet on a index fund that you do not directly partake in? Then why do you pay the MER?

All Index funds are mutual funds but not vice-versa. Mutual funds predate any kind of financial regulation and are a way for people to pool money together to buy collections of stocks conveniently during a time when the barrier of entry to the stock market was so high. Index funds are just mutual funds that track an index and as a result have lower MERs because they are not actively managed in anyway. Index funds just follow a formula and have lower operating costs as a result

What's the distinction with ETFs? ETFs are a form of Exchange-traded products. They are actual products that can be exchanged on the stock exchange. ETFs are effectively mutual funds that can be traded like stock. As a result, they leverage the securities exchange infrastructure and can make it more accessible for people. You can usually transfer ETF from one broker to another while brokers don't necessarily have access to all the mutual funds. Additionally the fact that the bundle of stocks, the ETF itself, is a security lets it act as a buffer for the fund manager to redistribute and fandangle before actually dealing with the underlying stocks and the secondary market. Effectively, the ETF can fluctuate its own security supply, unlike individual stocks which have a finite supply initially issued in the IPO. The person who regulates this ETF supply is the Authorized Participant (AP) who deals with the secondary market and makes the purchase or sales on the secondary market. The AP reduces the arbitrage between the ETF's price and its NAV (aka the value of its underlying assets). For example, ETF is at a premium to stock aka when more people want to buy the ETF, the AP will buy more ETFs by buying more stocks and reduce the spread between the ETF and the underlying stocks). In profiting from this arbitrage, the AP incurs the trading costs that mutual funds would incur since they do not have that additional arbitrage buffer that lets the middle man take on the costs. Capitalism at work. The liquidity of the ETF is therefore dependent on the liquidity of the underlying assets. The usual consequence of this is better capital gains tax advantages during stock redemptions.   ^356bfc

Mutual funds typically have to reserve cash to pay out withdrawals, but if they have to go the secondary market, the entire fund incurs a capital gain tax as it is better for the lower income individual investor to pay that tax then the high-income mutual fund.

## Operating Expenses 
ETFs have no 12b1 fees more tax efficient due to their [Shareholder redemption process](ETF%20tax%20and%20trading%20efficiencies%20compared%20to%20actively%20managed%20mutual%20funds%20and%20index%20funds.md) in the US and can be traded throughout the day. Mutual funds HAVE the 12b1 fees and orders can only be placed after market hours. Mutual fund managers may make realized capital gains causing all their shareholders to pay a capital gains tax. ETFs can be held like a stock. **12b1 fee** named after a section of the 1940 Investment act which let mutual funds market their funds the rationale being that it was better for the investor that the fund be marketed as more contributions are made.

ETFs are traded just like stocks so they are subject to the transaction fees of your national security exchange (such as US exchanges must pay a small amount to the SEC per the SEC act of 1934) while mutual funds can be bought commission-free but some may come with [loads](Loads.%20A%20type%20of%20commission.md)  (but they still come with heft MERs)

Why the distinction? The rationale is that ETFs are better in efficient markets and mutual funds are better in inefficient markets, but this really only applies to index ETFs.  In practicality, the ETF can be exactly identical to mutual funds except in how they are traded.

The popular ETFs are Index ETFs. ETFs are an umbrella term that include Index ETFs (aka index funds) that mirrors the asset allocation of a market index.
