We discuss 3 related functions:
1) The $\Gamma$ - function
2) The $\chi^2$-function
3) The $\beta$ - function
# The Gamma function
We discuss some of the mathematical properties of the gamma function:
- its factorial-like property
- the mean and its variance
But then we also discuss its applications and how it arises in some basic questions about failure and time until certain event occurs:
- The Hazard function: when something can be expected to fail given a certain elapse in time
- Waiting time in a Poisson Process: probability in the time one must wait until $k$th event occurs given a Poisson process
