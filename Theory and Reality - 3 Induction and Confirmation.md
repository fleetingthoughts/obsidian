We extend our previous discussion on the central dogmas of logical positivism/empiricism and the central problem the faced: the problem of induction. Beginning with a historical overview, the question of the reliability of induction was famously put forth by David Hume who was considered an inductive skeptic questioning whether there's any reason to believe that past events can tell us about the future. The logical positivists attempted to tackle this problem by developing an abstract theory (Hempel calls it a criteria) to justify induction. This chapter will explore:
- The use of deductive logic as a basis to formulate a theory of induction and the different types of nondeductive inferences
- The hypothetico-deductivist method put forth to provide a framework for induction: 
- Two famous problems that any good theory of induction must solve: Goodman's riddle of induction and Hempel's Paradox
A subtle nuance that PGS doesn't go into detail on is the distinction be between the terms "induction" and "confirmation" as used by the logical empiricists to soften their initial position. While induction refers to the general method, criteria, or abstract theory by which statements are verified or at least strengthened by empirical observations, "confirmation" was used primarily by Hempel as an abstract relation between sentences that lets us look at the validity or degree of validity of a statement. Effectively, induction was the general nondeductive way of evaluating the strength of statements based on empirical observations and confirmation was a relation between statements that served as a metric to measure how strong the statement is. To the logical empiricists, the problem of induction, the process by which we justify statements by past observations, is solved if we develop a suitable theory on confirmation. Historically, the idea of confirmation put forth by Hempel represented a softening of the verification principle of logical positivism as they surmised that while an attempt to absolutely validate an inductive argument, we can look at the degree of strength instead with confirmation. Carnap himself tried a pure probabilistic approach.

# The application of deductive logic to induction
In general, the logical empiricists took inspiration from logic and its abstract treatment of statements as simple relations that do not care for the content. For example, we can describe the relationship between two statements by sufficiency $A\implies B$ but these two statements can be anything. The aim was to establish a kind of logic that followed a similar form to that of deductive logic without caring for the content.

Historically, there's a bit of ambiguity in the different ways that the term "induction" and similar terms like "inference" are used in this context. It appears some of the Vienna circle used inductive logic to refer to any logic that isn't deductive, but within it, they recognized subcategories. PGS tries to summarize the ideas from the Vienna circle in his own way by using the terms differently. In PGS's words, there are 2 major kinds of nondeductive logics:
1) <u>Induction:</u>  refers to inferences from particular observations that confirm generalizations (p.42)
2) <u>Explanatory inference: </u> A structure or process that would explain the data (p. 43)
PGS admits in parentheses that projection is likely a 3rd kind but he believes its just a subtype of induction. The difference between "induction" and "explanatory inference" as used by PGS is that induction is when data is inferred to a generalization while explanatory inference has a pre-existing generalization that explains the data. Whether a hypothesis is presupposed is the difference. A theory of observation would need to account for both these kinds of inferences.
# Proposed theories of confirmation
A proposed view is the idea of hypothetic-deductivism. This term never had a specific definition, but the idea as described by PGS is as follows: hypotheses in science are confirmed when their logical consequences turn out to be true (p.45). The idea applies better to explanatory inferences as it suggests that a pre-supposed hypothesis is confirmed when deductively true statements about observables can be derived from it. The objection to this claim is that then any observation can confirm any statement for the following reasons:
1) Given statement $T$, if $T$ is true then deductively ($T$ or $S$)  is also true where $S$ can be any nonsense sentence which also means any observation that confirms $S$ also confirms ($T$ or $S$) which then confirms $T$. As an example $T$ can be a proper scientific statement like "the acceleration resulting from a force applied to an object is inversely proportional to its mass" and then $S$ can be a nonsense statement like "Carl has a wyrm for a pet".
2) If $T$ implies an observation $E$, then ($T$ & $S$) also implies $E$ where $S$ is any nonsense statement. 

# Two fundamental thought experiment problems
The section concludes with two fundamental problems that were put forth by Carl Hempel (Raven's paradox) and Nelson Goodman (Goodman's riddle of induction). These problems had implications in other field, but in this context, they were seen as problems that a suitable justification for induction had to account for.

## Raven's Paradox (Hempel's Paradox)
The Raven's paradox showed that a formal treatment of a hypothesis by deductive logic showed that seemingly unrelated observations also confirm the hypothesis. PGS goes through 3 possible solutions:
- Accept this counterintuitive result. This "paradox" is actually not a paradox (even though Hempel calls it that) and is simply unintuitive. We do not have to explain how these seemingly irrelevant observations do not confirm the original hypothesis, but that they do indeed confirm the hypothesis, but to a small degree. PGS notes that Hempel's solution also implies that any observation also implies hypothesis that conflict with the original hypothesis (which Hempel foresaw and accepted as a necessary consequence)
- I. J. Good's solution is that the thought experiment simplified the statement far too much and that the original hypothesis isn't a single statement but a bundle of other statements that heavily restricts the criteria for a relevant observation. This is related to Quine's holism in testing in that the criteria for an observation that confirms is actually a lot more strict because we're trying to verify a conjunction of several different hypotheses.
- Whether an observation confirms or denies a hypothesis depends on the order in which they are done for it influences your ability to refute a hypothesis.
Hempel foresaw both these responses. In response to the holism of testing, Hempel felt it went beyond the scope of his thought experiment as the intent was to distill a hypothesis down to a single statement and view its implications on confirmation which can then be used as a building block to look at holistic testing. Whether a hypothesis can be distilled in such a manner is a separate issue. With regards to the order of the observation, he proposed that the order did not matter at all and that whether you formulated the hypothesis before or after the observation has no bearing as the observation will be treated the same way regardless.

## Goodman's riddle of induction
While the riddle has several implications, we stick to the context and the issues that Goodman tried to highlight when he first put forth the problem. Goodman exposed the fundamental issue behind the Vienna's circle whole conceit of inductive logic. The Vienna circle attempted to abstract a theory that could relate statements irrespective of the content of the statements, but Goodman's riddle presents counterexample that shows a hypothesis with a nonsense competing hypothesis that are both confirmed by the same observation but we can clearly see one hypothesis is better than the other because of the content of the statements. This is exactly the issue of hypothetico-deductivism. <u>Goodman explains that what makes an inductive argument a good or bad one cannot just be its form (p.53)</u>.

Goodman claimed that another criteria for a good argument that an inductive logic has to account for is the content of the statements, not just its form and the evaluation of the content of a statement is a <u>language-relative matter</u> and depends on "what language we use as a starting point (p. 53)".

A possible solution is to introduce the criteria of simplicity: "Blue" is simpler than "Grue" because it doesn't have time dependency, but Goodman argues that how we evaluate simplicity is again a language-relative matter and so we're back to the same problem. Our language starting point began with "blue" so we find that the simpler term. PGS uses data analysis and curve fitting as a more objective situation to apply and illustrate Goodman's riddle and the idea of simplicity. Given any points, how do we determine what curve fits the points? A tendency will be for the "simpler" linear curve but that is a result of our "language starting point" of Euclidean geometry. A person starting with non-Euclidean geometry will find a non-linear curve simpler than a straight line on a Euclidean plane.

Goodman's riddle of induction illustrates the need to have the right "categories for prediction and extrapolation (p.55)" whether the categories be specific type of words or the right curve and not just words or functions in general.








- confirming the consequent
- induction vs explanatory inference, which is more fundamental?
- formulate an inductive logic close to deductive logic (Hempel instead tried to establish a criteria for sound judgement)
	- Hempel established a criteria for sound judgment
	- carnap tried probability 
	- hypothetico-deductivism: see if the logical consequences are true, but there are infinitely many logical consequences that contain nonsense
- Some problems that a good theory of inductive logic must solve (that the logical positivists dealt with)
	-  Raven's paradox: observations also confirm sentences logically equivalent to hypothesis. The observation of a seemingly irrelevant data point confirms original hypothesis:
		- Solution by Hempel: accept it
		- stacked assumptions
		- The order of the observation, relevancy, and refutation
	- Goodman's Riddle of induction: Challenges the idea that an inductive logic is irrespective of the actual content of the arguments and only depends on the form. The words we choose matter and has an inherent subjective bias. 
		- Solution: to accept that terms used must have a history of good use.
		- Content must be simplistic as possible as a solution but still depends on which language we use as a starting point
