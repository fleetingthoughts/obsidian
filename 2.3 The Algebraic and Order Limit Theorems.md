It should be noted that the [definition for convergence](2.2%20The%20Limit%20of%20a%20Sequence.md) came only 150 years after calculus was developed and so this definition was not necessary for calculus to develop but rather to be used to prove statements about convergence in general. Infinite sequences or series do not necessarily have the same algebraic properties of addition, multiplication, distribution, and/or associative. But we can prove that algebraic operations are valid for infinite sequences or series that have convergent properties.

We first lay some foundations by defining some key terms like "bounded" in the context of sequences

***Definition 2.3.1 (Bounded).*** A sequence $(x_n)$ is bounded if there exists a number $M>0$ such that $|x_n|\le M$ for all $n \in N$. 

Notice how this is separate from the definition of [bounded above](1.3%20The%20Axiom%20of%20Completeness.md) when postulating the Axiom of Completeness. In this definition, we are describing a sequence that is contained within an interval $[-M, M]$. With this definition we prove the following:

***Theorem 2.3.2 (Convergence of bounded sequences).*** Every convergent sequence is bounded.

Proof. By assumption of convergence we can determine a bound for a sequence $(x_n)$ know that it must be contained in the some interval around the limit, $l$, for a sufficient large $n$. Say we take $\epsilon = 1$ so that $x_n$ is contained in $(l-1,l+1)$ . The bound for these infinite terms outside of a finite $N$ number of terms is then by the [Reverse Triangle inequality.](Reverse%20Triangle%20inequality..md): 
$$|x_{n}|\le |l|+1$$

Then we can determine the maximum of the other finite $N$ terms and take the bound $M$ to be the the maximum of the magnitude of the finite terms and the bound of the remaining infinite terms:
$$M = max(|x_{1}|,x_{2}|,\dots |x_{N-1}|,|l|+1)$$
Q.E.D.

We now show that convergent infinite sequences behave well with respect to addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and order as a property of the sequences, the limit, behaves as usual under these operations:

***Theorem 2.3.3 (Algebraic Limit Theorem).*** Let lim $a_n=a$   and lim $b_n=b$. Then we have:
(i) $lim(ca_n)$ = ca, for all $c ∈ R$; 
(ii) $lim(a_n + b_n) = a + b$; (proved using the triangular inequality)
(iii) $lim(a_nb_n) = ab$; (prove using triangular inequality and using the trick of adding extra terms that sum to 0. We also have to apply Theorem 2.3.2)
(iv) $lim(a_n/b_n) = a/b$ , provided $b \ne  0$ 

The proof from each of these theorems involve setting our presumed convergent series $|a_n-a| \lt \text{anything we like}$ which by hypothesis we can do by setting $n >N$. Then algebraically manipulate it to our goal of $$|\text{(terms of sequence)} - \text{(proposed limit) } | < \epsilon$$
But to determine that "anything we like" we do some math toolbox-esque "black magic" to construct it.

I think it is useful to see the proof for (iv) to show the math tricks involved to prove convergence and its application of the [Reverse Triangle inequality.](Reverse%20Triangle%20inequality..md) Proof: Assuming (iii) is true, it is then sufficient to prove (iv) by showing $(b_n) \to b \implies \frac{1}{b_n} \to \frac{1}{b}$ . We now apply our math toolbox-esque "black magic" to reverse engineer the $|\frac{1}{b_n} \to \frac{1}{b}| \lt \text{anything we like}$
1) $$ \frac{1}{b_n} \to \frac{1}{b} = \frac{|b_n-b|}{|b_n||b|}$$

The difficulty here is with the $|b_n|$ term which is not a constant and we cannot apply Theorem 2.3.2 to replace it with a constant, but we do take advantage of the fact that we can make $b_n$ close to $b$ then to 0 namely by assumption we can select $n \ge N_1$ such that:
2) $$|b_n-b| \lt \frac{|b|}{2}$$
By [Reverse Triangle inequality.](Reverse%20Triangle%20inequality..md):
3) $$|b_n|-|b| \le |b_n - b|$$
so combining 3) into 2) we have:
$$|b_n| \lt \frac{3|b|}{2}$$
4) $$|b_n| \gt \frac{3|b|}{2}\gt \frac{|b|}{2}$$
So overall we have our target epsilon reverse engineered by combining 4) into 1):
$$\frac{1}{b_n} \to \frac{1}{b} = \frac{|b_n-b|}{|b_n||b|}\lt \frac{2|b_n-b|}{|b|^2}$$So if we simply set $n >N_{2}$ such that $|b_n - b| \lt \epsilon\frac{|b|^2}{2}$ while simultaneously letting $n \gt N_1$ to satisfy 2) by setting $n \gt max(N_1,N_2)$, then we obtain our desired convergence criteria for $|\frac{1}{b_n} \to \frac{1}{b}| \lt \epsilon$ 

# Limits and Order

After showing that convergent sequences are well-behaved under algebraic operations, we show that they also respect order operations:

Theorem 2.3.4 (Order Limit Theorem). Assume $\lim_{n \to \infty}a_{n} = a$  and $\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = b$.
(i) If $a_n ≥ 0$  for all $n ∈ N$, then $a ≥ 0$.
(ii) If $a_n ≤ b_n$ for all $n ∈ N$, then $a ≤ b$ (proved by applying theorem 2.3.3)
(iii) If there exists $c ∈ R$ for which $c ≤ b_n$ for all $n ∈ N$, then $c ≤ b$. Similarly,
if $a_n ≤ c$ for all $n ∈ N$, then $a ≤ c$.

A remark on the properties we derived for limits. Convergence only depends on the what happens to the "tail-end" of a sequence. Notice that convergence assumes something about the infinite number of terms at the end of the term and excludes a finite number of $n < N_1$ terms. We essentially don't care what we tack on or how many of those finite terms there are as long as we expect a certain behavior from the infinite terms at the "tail-end" of the sequence. Generally we care about what happens "eventually" to a sequence

***Exercise 2.2.7 Eventually*** Given a set $A$, a property is "eventually" in the set if there exists $N_{1} \in N$ such that the property applies to all $a_n \in A$ when $n \ge N_1$
