It should be noted that the [definition for convergence](2.2%20The%20Limit%20of%20a%20Sequence.md) came only 150 years after calculus was developed and so this definition was not necessary for calculus to develop but rather to be used to prove statements about convergence in general. Infinite sequences or series do not necessarily have the same algebraic properties of addition, multiplication, distribution, and/or associative. But we can prove that algebraic operations are valid for infinite sequences or series that have convergent properties.

We first lay some foundations by defining some key terms like "bounded"

***Definition 2.3.1 (Bounded).*** A sequence $(x_n)$ is bounded if there exists a number $M>0$ such that $|x_n|\le M$ for all $n \in N$. 

Notice how this is separate from the definition of [bounded above](1.3%20The%20Axiom%20of%20Completeness.md) when postulation the Axiom of Completeness. In this definition, we are describing a sequence that is contained within an interval $[-M, M]$. With this definition we prove the following:

***Theorem 2.3.2 (Convergence of bounded sequences).*** Every convergent sequence is bounded.

Proof. By assumption of convergence we can determine a bound for a sequence $(x_n)$ know that it must be contained in the some interval around the limit, $l$, for a sufficient large $n$. Say we take $\epsilon = 1$ so that $x_n$ is contained in $(l-1,l+1)$ . The bound for these infinite terms outside of a finite $N$ number of terms is then:
$$|x_{n}|\le |l|+1$$

Then we can determine the maximum of the other finite $N$ terms and take the bound $M$ to be the the maximum of the magnitude of the finite terms and the bound of the remaining infinite terms:
$$M = max(|x_{1}|,x_{2}|,\dots |x_{N-1}|,|l|+1)$$ We now that show that convergent infinite sequences behave well with respect to addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and order as a property of the sequences, the limit, behaves as usual under these operations:

***Theorem 2.3.3 (Algebraic Limit Theorem).*** Let lim $a_n=a$   and lim $b_n=b$. Then we have:
(i) $lim(ca_n)$ = ca, for all $c ∈ R$; 
(ii) $lim(a_n + b_n) = a + b$; (proved using the triangular inequality)
(iii) $lim(a_nb_n) = ab$; (prove using triangular inequality and using the trick of adding extra terms that sum to 0)
(iv) $lim(a_n/b_n) = a/b$ , provided $b \ne  0$ (prove that if $(b_n)\to b$ implies $\frac{1}{b_n} \to  \frac{1}{b}$  )

# Limits and Order

After showing that convergent sequences are well-behaved under algebraic operations, we show that they also respect order operations:

Theorem 2.3.4 (Order Limit Theorem). Assume lim an = a and lim bn = b.
(i) If $a_n ≥ 0$  for all $n ∈ N$, then $a ≥ 0$.
(ii) If $a_n ≤ b_n$ for all $n ∈ N$, then $a ≤ b$.
(iii) If there exists $c ∈ R$ for which $c ≤ b_n$ for all $n ∈ N$, then $c ≤ b$. Similarly,
if $a_n ≤ c$ for all $n ∈ N$, then $a ≤ c$.
