Writing should not be treated at a linear process that requires a brainstorming session at the start. Why is creating a new idea to write about like a research topic so hard? It is because we do not have a flexible repository to draw upon already existing ideas. Students can spend years and not have any good topics to think about because they have not organized their existing thoughts. 

How do we exercise a flexible repository of information to draw upon ideas that do the brainstorming for us? Enter the slip box. In this sense, the slip box is an evergreen process to constantly exercise our existing ideas and make connections.
