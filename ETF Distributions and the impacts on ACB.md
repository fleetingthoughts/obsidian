When a fund manager sells the underlying stocks, the fund can be allocated as a taxable event to the other fund owners and the capital gains can be distributed in different ways. How the gains/loss is distributed affects your ACB differently. Capital gains distributed as cash will have to be adjusted on the ACB to avoid double taxation. [Brokers may not do the best job keeping track of this ACB](Bookkeeping%20of%20ACB.md) . If the cash came from dividend or interest, then it is taxed accordingly and no adjustment is made to the ACB. If the capital gains is returned as an ROC, then it adjusts your ACB down to avoid double taxation. 

ACB of $10,000 -> ETF fund makes capital gains of $500 -> you pay the capital gains -> ACB = 10,000+500=10,500. 

The ACB goes up to minimize the difference when you eventually sell your entire holding. 

Capital gains made by the fund manager can be reinvested by the manager without the fund investors knowing. The reinvesting of the capital gains back into the fund resulting in capital gains tax on the owners referred to as a Phantom Distribution and it can only occur at the end of the year on December meaning there is some optimization in the [timing](ETF%20capital%20gains%20distribution%20practices.md#^79c224) in which purchase an ETF. It's referred to as a "phantom" distribution because capital gains usually results in some kind of cash distribution to the original investor, but it doesn't in this case as the cash only passed hands briefly with the fund manager before being reinvested. The ACB still needs to be adjusted accordingly as the capital gains is distributed to the fund owners. This can result from stocks being sold after being deleted from the fund's benchmark index which happened following an increase in price as it did with [iShares](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/11/17/1043703/0/en/BlackRock-R-Canada-Announces-Estimated-2016-Annual-Reinvested-Capital-Gains-Distributions-for-the-iShares-R-ETFs.html).  This may be a reason why [indexes that look at "undervalued" stocks](Chapter%205%20Selecting%20the%20appropriate%20index%20ETF.md#^9854d8) can result in high capital gains as it is self-defeating in that if a company appreciates in value, it falls out of the index and you're hooked with the capital gains. ^6d9d46

Capital gains distributions are tax inefficient and are minimized in index funds vs their actively mutual fund counterparts since turnover is generally lower.

From my understanding, Dividends tax on domestic equities that avoid any [Foreign Withholding Tax](Foreign%20Withholding%20Tax.md) are lower than capital gains tax typically so Phantom Distributions may be less preferable than a cash payout. 

ACB calculation can get quite complicated and there are some [guidelines to simplify the accounting of the ACB](Bookkeeping%20of%20ACB.md).
