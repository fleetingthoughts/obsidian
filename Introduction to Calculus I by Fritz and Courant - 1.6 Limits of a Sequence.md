A specific definition of the limit is not offered here, but the author appeals to intuitition to show that the sequence $(a_n)=\frac{c}{n}$ for any constant $c$ tends to 0 as $n\to \infty$ and uses this result to  determine the limit of other sequences $(a_{n})$ as $n \to \infty$  and the results are worth remembering:

1) $a_{n}=\sqrt[n]{p}=1$. Where $p>0$.  The proof applies the trick of [lower bounds of binomials](Lower%20bounds%20of%20binomials.md)
2) $a_n= \alpha^n=0$ where $|\alpha|<1$. The trick is to substitute $\alpha = (1+h)^{-n}$ and apply the [Lower bounds of binomials](Lower%20bounds%20of%20binomials.md)
3) $a_n=\sqrt[n]{n}=1$. Proof again applies the [Lower bounds of binomials](Lower%20bounds%20of%20binomials.md)
