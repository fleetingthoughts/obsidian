The mutual fund and ETF structure itself as a security provides it an advantage to minimize capital gains tax for the investor. Higher capitals gains occur when you sell a share that went up higher in price relative to when you bought it. When a fund stock redemption occurs (issuer buys back their own security aka when investor sells the share), the fund has the flexibility to give away the stocks with the lowest purchase price and sell the stocks in the ETF with the highest price to minimize capital gains. 

Generally index ETFs inherently reduce [taxable events](ETF%20Taxable%20events.md) by not actively managing them. Compared to their index mutual fund counterparts, the ETF can further reduce taxable events as the ETF is a security itself that can be traded with other investors shielding the fund itself from having to meet investor withdrawals. The ETF redemption scenario of course only occurs if the market maker is unable to find another retail investor to purchase the security and avoids security and stock redemption all together. Hence ETFs benefit from more popularity and higher volumes to reduce the amount of times these redemption scenario occurs. So this further reduces taxable events for the investor where it minimizes in-fund trading

Only certain authorized dealers (also called authorized participants or AP) can redeem ETF units directly and the ETF is redeemed by "in-kind" redemption transactions (i.e. trading security ETF for security stocks). This means the AP is the one that shoulders the trading costs and capital gains cost of the underlying asset.


These tactics do nothing for dividends which will still be taxed at the designated rate (remember dividends tax rate is separate and typically lower than capital gains tax because the company already pays taxes on that revenue), but reinvesting the dividend lets you avoid the tax entirely.
