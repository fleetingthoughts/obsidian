Investors can choose to reinvest their dividend to purchase more stock (i.e. dividend reinvestment) and brokerages like WealthSimple let you set that up. Note that even though this means you practically never see the cash in your account if your brokerage allows for fractional purchasing, it is still treated as dividend income that gets taxed.
