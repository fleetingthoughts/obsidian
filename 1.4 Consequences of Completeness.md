In this section, we now formalize a lot of intuition we have about the different fields within and including R and how $N, Q, Z$ fit into $R$ as well we deduce a theorem that formalizes the idea of the set of real numbers having no "gaps" in it. 

For the latter, the idea of no gaps is the following theorem

***Theorem 1.4.1. (The Nested Interval Property).*** For a given closed interval $I_n = [a_n, b_n]=\{x\in R: a_n \le x \le b_n\}$, with $I_n$ such that $I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq I_3 ...$ then  $\cap I_n \ne \emptyset$  

This theorem means that for a closed nested interval, it must always contain the same element. Note that a closed interval is used so that we can talk about a specific element being part of the set. This can be shown by looking at the set of either the right left hand endpoints and showing that they constitute a bounded set and must have a supremum or infimum that is included in the set (i.e. it is a maximum/minimum).

Now we look at how $N$ is infinite within $R$, namely,  the set of all natural numbers is not bounded and so has no least greater bound per the AoC:

***Theorem 1.4.2 (Archimedean property)***. Given any $x \in R$, there exists an $n \in N$ such that $n \gt x$ 

Essentially this theorem says that we can never find an upper bound for the set of all natural numbers and so there will never be a supremum and is trivially proven. It seems like non-sense but the idea of $R$ being an extension of $Q$ necessitates us to double check we didn't unwittingly create upper bounds for $N$ for there are ordered field extensions that actually do that.
