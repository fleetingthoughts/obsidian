In this section, we now formalize a lot of intuition we have about the different fields within and including R and how $N, Q, Z$ fit into $R$ as well we deduce a theorem that formalizes the idea of the set of real numbers having no "gaps" in it. 

For the latter, the idea of no gaps is the following theorem

***Theorem 1.4.1. (The Nested Interval Property).*** For a given closed interval $I_n = [a_n, b_n]=\{x\in R: a_n \le x \le b_n\}$, with $I_n$ such that $I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq I_3 ...$ then  $\cap I_n \ne \emptyset$  

This theorem means that for a closed nested interval, it must always contain the same element. Note that a closed interval is used so that we can talk about a specific element being part of the set. This can be shown by looking at the set of either the right left hand endpoints and showing that they constitute a bounded set and must have a supremum or infimum that is included in the set (i.e. it is a maximum/minimum).

Now we look at how $N$ is infinite within $R$, namely,  the set of all natural numbers is not bounded and so has no least greater bound per the AoC:

***Theorem 1.4.2 (Archimedean property)***. Given any $x \in R$, there exists an $n \in N$ such that $n \gt x$. Furthermore ii) Given any real number $y \gt 0$, there exists an $n \in N$ such that $1/n \lt y$ 

Essentially this theorem says that we can never find an upper bound for the set of all natural numbers and so there will never be a supremum and is trivially proven. It seems like non-sense but the idea of $R$ being an extension of $Q$ necessitates us to double check we didn't unwittingly create upper bounds for $N$ for there are ordered field extensions that actually do that. This can be proven by contradiction using Lemma 1.3.8 and using a specific case of $\epsilon$ =1 to show that no real number can be an upper bound.

Using Theorem 1.4.2, we can now formalize the idea that $R$ is an "extension" of $Q$ by containing all the irrational numbers as well. The idea here is that $Q$ is "infinitely dense" and we can find any possible combination of it within the real numbers. This is formalized as follows:

***Theorem 1.4.3 (Density of Q in R)***. For every two real numbers $a \lt b$ , there exists a rational number $r$ such that $a \lt r\lt b$.

Note that we use $\lt$ and not $\le$. My opinion is that this is a stronger proof as it contains it in a smaller set. we essentially. This is proven using the Archimedean property to determine a suitable denominator and an analogous proof can be adopted for the density of irrational numbers (1.4.5).

We can also prove the existence of certain irrational numbers like $\sqrt2$  in the real using only rational numbers by constructing a bounded set of rational numbers (therefore by the AoC it MUST have a supremum) and that the supremum must be some quantity $\alpha$ such that $\alpha^2 =2$. The proof by constructing a bounded set with a supremum equal to the number we want to prove the existence of shows a property resulting from AoC called the property or Dedekind cut and is a method of constructing the numbers we want to prove the existence of by partitioning a set into two precisely at the number we want to "construct" or prove the existence of. In fact this cut property is logically equivalent to AoC and we could use either as our starting point to define real numbers as the set of rational numbers with irrational numbers filling the gaps (see Exercise 1.3.10)
