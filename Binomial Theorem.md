The binomial theorem describes the algebraic expansion of powers and states that the expansion of powers of a polynomial with two terms (a binomial) follows the binomial formula/binomial identity: $$(x+y)^n= {n \choose 0} x^ny^0+ {n \choose 1}x^{n-1}y^1+{n\choose 2}x^{n-2}y^{2}+...+{n \choose n-1}x^1y^{n-1}|+{n\choose n} x^0y^n$$
Where the symbol ${n\choose k}$ is called a binomial coefficient (both the coefficient itself and the symbol) and referred to as "$n$ choose $k$" and is computed by:
$${n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
The binomial formula is expressed more concisely in summation notation:
$$(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{n\choose k}x^{n-k}y^k$$
On top of expanding binomials, it also is useful in creating [Lower bounds of binomials](Lower%20bounds%20of%20binomials.md)
