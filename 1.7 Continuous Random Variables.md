We could get an intuitive sense of what variables should be discrete random variables by determining whether the sample space is countable or finite, but we look to the actual property of the cdf to distinguish a continuous random variable

***Definition 1.7.1 (Continuous Random Variables).*** A random variable is a continuous random variable if its cumulative distribution function is a continuous function for all $x \in R$.

This definition seems to be a consequence of the fact that if the sample space isn't countable and it is "greater" than it must extend to the set of all real numbers as there's no continuum of cardinality between the set of natural numbers and real numbers. 

The <u>support </u> of the continuous random variable $x \in X$ is analogous to the definition for discrete variables where it all the points $x$ such that $p(x) \gt 0$ . By definition of the cdf, we can derive two properties of the pdf:
1) $p_x(x) \ge 0$ 
2) $\int_{\infty}^{\infty} p_x(t)dt = 1$ 
Outside of the scope of this book but it can be shown solely that if a function satisfies both these properties than it is a pdf for a continuous random variable 

## 1.7.1 Quantiles
We define some ways to characterize thresholds within the cdf
***Definition 1.7.2 (Quantile).*** Given a number $0\lt p \lt 1$, the quantile of order $p$ of the distribution of a random variable $X$ is a value $\gamma$ such that $P(X \lt \gamma) \le p$ and $P(X \lt \gamma) \ge p$. It is also known as the (100p)th percentile of $X$ 

## 1.7.2 Transformations
Transformations of a random variable are themselves random variables and we can determine what the pdf or cdf becomes if we know the pdf of the original random variable.

***Theorem 1.7.1 (Determining the pdf of the transformation of a random variable).*** Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with the pdf $f_X(x)$ and support on $S_X$. Let $Y = g(X)$, where $g(x)$ is a 1-1 differentiable function, on $S_X$. Then the pdf of $Y$ is the following:
$$ f_{Y}(y)=f_{X} g^{-1}(y)|\frac{dx}{dy}|$$This can be proven by chain theorem on the following fact:
$$ F_{Y}(y)=P(Y \le y) = P(g(X)\le y) = P(X \le g^{-1}(y))$$
The absolute value arises from us restricting the transformation to be invertible. The absolute value may just be for obvious convenience because it is necessarily positive from how we constrain it  The last term of the theorem $|\frac{dx}{dy}|$ which is equal to $\frac {d}{dy}g^{-1}(y)$ is referred to as the Jacobian of the transformation $x = g^{-1}(y)$
