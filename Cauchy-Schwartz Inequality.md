One of the most used inequalities that makes use of the fact that a number squared is non-negative. In one dimension, it is:
$$(a_1b_1+a_2b_2+...+a_nb_n)^2 \le (a_1^2+a_2^2+...+a_n^2)(b_1^2+b_2^2+...+b_n^2)$$

In the special case that $n=2$, we achieve the result that the geometric mean of two positive numbers never exceeds the arithmetic mean by choosing 
$$a_1 = \sqrt x ;a_2 = \sqrt y; b_1= \sqrt y; b_2 = \sqrt x$$
