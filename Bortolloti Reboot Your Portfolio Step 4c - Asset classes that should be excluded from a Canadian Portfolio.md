Bortlotti argues that the following asset classes should not be included in a Canadian Portfolio
- REITs
- Preferred Stocks
- Real return bonds
- Junk bonds

In general, these asset classes are not desirable as they are highly concentrated in a hand few institutions in the Canadian market, thereby increasing volatility in the portfolio without the historic yields to justify it especially in the Canadian Market [which should be the focus for a Canadian investor's fixed income allocation](Bortolloti%20Reboot%20Your%20Portfolio%20Step%204b%20What%20Fixed%20income%20assets%20to%20add%20to%20your%20portfolio.md). 

REITs are required by law to distribute its revenues to shareholders to avoid paying corporate tax and are a popular source of fixed income and are generally not correlated with the stock market. But a typical equity asset allocation will already have exposure to the real-estate market and so investing in REITs will be double dipping in a market you already have exposure to. Additionally, the Canadian REIT market is highly concentrated in very few companies and increase your volatility. REITs are not eligible for dividend tax credit and so they're tax inefficient as well.

Preferred shares are shares that have first dibs on dividends before other shareholders. They are taxed more favorably, and so they make no sense in accounts that are already tax-sheltered like TFSAs and RRSPs. The majority of preferred shares in Canada are again focused primarily in the major banking and insurance sector and so add little to no diversification to a portfolio and will risk double dipping as a Canadian portfolio will already have a [high exposure to Canadian banks](Bortolloti%20Reboot%20Your%20Portfolio%20Step%204a%20What%20Equity%20Assets%20Classes%20to%20add%20to%20your%20allocation.md). They also have historically low yields, but in my opinion is a weak argument as the entire book has argued against performance chasing.

Real return bonds mediate the standard problem most bonds have in their vulnerability to high inflation rates by adjusting their value to the Consumer Price Index. These bonds have extremely high maturity rates and are subject to large price swings adding unwanted volatility to an asset allocation that was designed to reduce volatility. A higher equity asset allocation should be looked at if high-yield assets are desired. Junk bonds, bonds in companies with a higher chance of default, are also undesired for the same logic
