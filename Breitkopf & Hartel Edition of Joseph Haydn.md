Breitkopf and Hartel had previously attempted a critical urtext edition of Haydn's complete works from 1907-33 but had aborted at 11 out of 20 volumes. The following volumes were published and reprinted later by Edwin F. Kalmus in the English-speaking country:
- Serie 1: Symphonien (4 vols)
- Serie 14: Klavierwerke (3 volumes of the Sonatas)
- Serie 16 (3 volumes)
- Series 20 (1 volume)
The Sonatas were later re-issued and edited by the German composer, pianist, and conductor Herman Zilcher based on the original aborted project with his instructive fingerings and suggestions as Haydn rarely added his own fingerings.
