Motivated by the concept of vectors applied to experimental quantities such as velocity and distance in the previous chapter, we now treat these vectors as mathematical objects themselves that can in turn have applications beyond our initial motivations to describe quantities in physics.

In the previous chapter, we had established [8 axioms](Linear%20Algebra%20by%20Friedberg,%20Insel,%20and%20Spence%20-%201.1%20Introduction.md) that vectors followed to describe experimental results. We now use these axioms to formally describe the algebraic structure that will contain our vector mathematical objects
***Definition of a Vector Space (p. 6).*** A vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is consists of a set on which addition and scalar multiplication are defined so that any vectors in the set are closed under addition or scalar multiplication, that is, for any vector $x$ and $y$ and element $a$ in $F$, $x+y$  and  $ax$ produces a vector that is contained in $V$. Furthermore, the following 8 conditions are satisfied:
1) Commutativity of vector addition
2) Associativity of vector addition
3) The existence of the null vector
4) The existence of the inverse of a vector by addition
5) The existence of the identity scalar
6) The associativity of scalar multiplication
7) Left distributive property of scalar-to-vector multiplication
8) Right distributive property of scalar-to-vector multiplication
It is worth emphasizing that vectors now go beyond descriptions of experimental quantities in the previous chapter and are now just elements in a vector space. 

We now describe
