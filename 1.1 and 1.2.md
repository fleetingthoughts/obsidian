Covers a couple proof writing techniques and general heuristics about the real numbers and its subsets

- We looked <u>proof by contradiction</u> using the irrationality of the square root of non-perfect squared integers as an example.


- not a formal but general definition of what a ***field*** is and what an ***<u>ordered field</u>*** is: something you can apply the usual addition multiplication , commutative, associative and distributive property while having some sense of order to let you carry out inequality operations. More formal definition in Section 8
-  Some basic standard notation for the different fields:
	- R - real numbers
	- Q - fractions (i.e. rational numbers)
	- Z - integers
	- N - natural numbers
- Dirichlet introduced the formal definition of a function to formalize the Fourier series. It also let him create his wonky Dirichlet functions.
- Triangle inequality
- If and only if forward and backward meaning
- <u>Proof by induction </u> :
For some set S that is a subset of  N
1)  $S$ contains 1 
2)  Whenever $S$ contains a natural number $n$, it also contains $n+1$ 
 Why is it a valid argumentative technique and its implications on natural numbers? for later. We'll return to Natural numbers after exploring $R$
