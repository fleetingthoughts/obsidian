After aligning your asset allocation with your financial plans and taking the author's advice on what asset classes are worth investing. We now examine the financial instruments that the author preaches: ETFs.

The author gives an overview of indexes and what they generall track: How are indexes built what are some examples and why are they useful? They're useful for giving an overview of the market and some good ones include:
- S&P 500 - represents 80% of the US market and are the 500 largest companies
- Rusell 3000 index is like the S&P 500 but it includes some mid-sized and smaller companies making it more complete
- S&P/TSX composite is the 250 largest companies in Canada and is the Canadian analogue to the S&P 500
- MSCI EAFE tracks Europe, Australasia and the Far East
Some poor ones include:
- Dow Jones Industrial average- weighted based on Share Price and was used for historic reasons that are now irrelevant as it was easier to calculate with pencil paper.

Indexes vary in methodology. The most popular one that the author praises are market-capitalized indexes. But other factors may influence how the fund tracking the index is put together:
- liquidity: the stock may not be liquid enough and cannot be purchased in the fund
- limit on the weight a single asset can hold. We want to avoid a Nortel situation on the S&P/TSX composite index, so no one asset completely dominates your portfolio.
He provides a brief history of ETFs as ETFs were originally created to track indexes, but now that the industry has exploded, they look more like mutual funds with a fresh coat of paint. [ETFs are just mutual funds that are securities that can be exchanged](Mutual%20Funds%20vs%20ETFs%20vs%20Index%20funds.md#^356bfc). 

Then he talks about selecting the appropriate indexes to add and avoid. The emphasis is on the index meeting our goal in finding a broad and inclusive exposure to the market. As such, specific indexes do not matter and indeed some of the more well-known indexes like S&P charge high licensing fees to index funds. He vouches for cap-weighted indexes as they are effectively the price of the market that you are buying and have typically low turnover. The larger the index the better, this can offset undesirable consequences like companies falling outside the criteria of the index (i.e,. becoming bankrupt) but if your index is broad enough, the impact will be miniscule.

Indexes to avoid are the ones that do not meet our goal of having a broad an inclusive exposure to the market such as the Dow Jones which only tracks a committee selected 30 companies.  Additionally the NASDAQ 100 is more tech-focused.

A criticism of these cap-weighted indexes is that we may be purchasing overvalued stocks that have a high market capitalization and not allocating enough into the undervalued stocks, but the assumption presumes that value correlates to yield which [is not always a good indicator](Chapter%201%20Evaluating%20the%20Alternatives%20To%20passive%20ETF%20investing.md#^19088a). This is another "beat the market" argument. One alternative he looks at are equal-weighted index which may make sense for sectors where the total number of stocks is small, but this again is not a good exposure to the "market" defeating our original purpose in finding a broad and inclusive exposure to the market. The impact of each sector depends in these indexes are more influenced by the number of companies rather than the impact on the economy. These are distortions of the market that may for example equate 5 small mining companies to the large banks in the Canadian market. ^9854d8

Next we look at  smart beta ETFs which bred a field of "alternative indexing" funds. Some background is required. Beta is a measure of risk. Stock with high beta is more sensitive to a stock market's ups and downs. The traditional cap-weighted index is essentially chasing this beta. On the other side of the spectrum is Alpha which is represented by mutual funds that try to find high alpha stocks that beat the beta. Smart beta is somwhere in between in trying to beat that market by tracking certain factors. Although there is no consensus on what these are, some include:
- Value
- size
- momentum
But this is just "beating the market" with a new coat of paint. Arguments against smart beta include:
- high costs to do this research and tracking
- lack of transparency in very dense PHD level formulae for the regular investor
- Validity of the research
The last point is worth elaborating. The premise of the smart beta methods is essentially to find hidden metrics and "value" that no one else sees. It is essentially finding undervalued stocks. But doesn't this play into a zero-sum game where, if there is truth to any of the research, then any of the hidden value becomes public and arbitraged away. The research conducted by smart beta investors may not hold in the future once these conclusions are known and proven to be valid. It is Goodhart's law in full effect.

Next the author discusses currency hedging and argues that ETFs that hedge their currency should be avoided. Currency hedged funds are for investments in foreign markets that protect against the rising of your local currency to the foreign one. If your currency does better, the currency hedged fund will increase in value. If your currency does worse, then the value of the fund goes down. The author argues that exposure to foreign currency reduces volatility of Canadian equity investments ([note this runs counter to the advice for fixed income asset classes due to foreign withholding tax](Chapter%204b%20What%20Fixed%20income%20assets%20to%20add%20to%20your%20portfolio.md#^d06605)) and a currency hedged fund defeats this purpose by double dipping into your domestic equity allocation. In investing in a currency hedged fund, you've essentially double downed on your position in your domestic market. You should just consider a larger allocation in your domestic market instead. 
	- Side note: the author differentiates purchasing foreign assets from buying the foreign assets IN the foreign currency (e.g. buying US funds in US dollars vs Canadian dollars). With the former, you will still have the same exposure to foreign currency as the underlying assets are exposed to it. All you've done is double downed on the foreign market, by dumping your currency in there as well and anti-hedged your currency (you will have lost out if the loonies rises relative to the USD) while also incurring foreign exchange fees. You would be better off allocating more in domestic equities. 

How do we evaluate an index funds performance? The author has already spent [a chapter talking about how past performance is not a reliable indicator of value](Chapter%201%20Evaluating%20the%20Alternatives%20To%20passive%20ETF%20investing.md#^48acec). What he advocates for instead is evaluating on the current operation of the fund. This can be done by looking at its tracking error. A consistently large tracking error is a big red flag for an ETF. Tracking error is the difference between the index the ETF tracks and the actual returns. Actual returns are usually less due to inevitable expenses, but a significant difference may mean the fund is not well-managed. Undesirable costs to the investor that result in a large tracking error include:
- manage expense ratio (MER)
- trading expense ratio (TER): result from frequent trades expressed as a total of the funds assets. Funds should have TERs < 3-10 basis points.
- withholding tax on dividends: The IRS for example holds 15% on dividends on US stocks paid inside Canadian-listed ETFs
Although the tracking error may also be a result of innocuous reasons such as sampling error. A fund simply cannot perfectly track an index for reasons like illiquid stocks. Theoretically, sampling errors should can cause index funds to appear to overperform the index it tracks.
