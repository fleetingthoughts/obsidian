Book is written by Peter-Godfrey Smith. A biologist and philosopher who per his preface compiled his lectures into this book. The topics cover go in roughly chronological order starting with the logical positivists in the 19th century to modern day sociological and historical treatment of the scientific method and the goal of philosophy in science.

The book provides a good survey of the major milestones over the past century and provides further reading suggestions with each chapter covering a milestone or overall "community circle".

I suggest categorizing the book by chapter and then along with the major points to further identify the following: 
- key people (for followup reading)
- key terms used and definitions (as the philosophy of science has much to do with the use of language and its full context), 
- historical examples.
