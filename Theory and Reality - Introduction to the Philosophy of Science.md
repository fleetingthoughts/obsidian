In my study of the sciences, I have become curious into the creative and investigative methodologies of the vast subjects that all fall under the singular term "science". What is science and what can be considered good or even great science? How has the course of science changed with different subjects like alchemy and psychoanalysis considered pseudoscience and quantum mechanics considered scientific? In asking these questions, I have considered it useful to take a step back and look at the giant <u>institution</u> that is science and examine the criteria that makes science what itis so that I may improve my own creative process and take a meta-analysis of my studies. We are ultimately subjective humans and taking a lateral look at the implications of our nature in our attempts at scientific investigation (what that even means is worth questioning!) in the similar one may analyze the different ways cognitive bias may creep into something as "objective" as science, but perhaps the bias is a useful feature to science. It appears to me that all great scientists, such as Feynman, were great philosophers inquiring into the epistemological and metaphysical nature of the very things they were studying which spurned their creative inquiries especially as I recall Feynman's questioning of the nature of energy in my youth. 


Theory and Reality provides a good survey of the major milestones over the past century and provides further reading suggestions with each chapter covering a milestone or overall "community circle".

I suggest categorizing the book by chapter and then along with the major points to further identify the following: 
- key people (for follow-up reading)
- key terms used and definitions (as the philosophy of science has much to do with the use of language and its full context), 
- historical examples.

The book is well organized into its chapters with a crystal thesis that one can extract or interpret. I have provided my own as follows:
1) [Introduction](Theory%20and%20Reality%20-%201%20Introduction.md): 
	- The two basic questions that the book will answer. 
	- The two criteria to evaluate the various ideas surveyed in the book and the 3 different levels they apply to
	- 3 tentative pieces that answer what science is.
2) [Logic Plus Empricism](Theory%20and%20Reality%20-%202%20Logic%20Plus%20Empricism.md): 
	- Overview of the philosophy of the Vienna Circle and logical positivism/empiricism and the philosophy they were reacting against 
	- Two central dogmas to their philosophy
	- The challenges to their two dogmas
3) [Induction and Confirmation](Theory%20and%20Reality%20-%203%20Induction%20and%20Confirmation.md)
	- The logical empiricists/positivists approach to the problem of induction and the application of confirmation
	- Different types of nondeductive inferences
	- Hypothetico-deductivism
	- 2 thought experiment problems that any theory of confirmation must answer
4) [Popper: Conjecture and Refutation](Theory%20and%20Reality%20-%204%20Popper's%20Conjecture%20and%20Refutation.md)]
	- Popper's criteria for science and the demarcation from non-science
	- Popper's normative views on science
	- Objections to Popper's views on the criteria for Science and confirmation and Popper's response
