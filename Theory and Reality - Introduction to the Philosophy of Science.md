In my study of the sciences, I have become curious into the creative and investigative methodologies of the vast subjects that all fall under the singular term "science". What is science and what can be considered good or even great science? How has the course of science changed with different subjects like alchemy and psychoanalysis considered pseudoscience and quantum mechanics considered scientific? In asking these questions, I have considered it useful to take a step back and look at the giant <u>institution</u> that is science and examine its workings and what makes it tick so that I may improve my own creative process and take a meta-analysis of my studies. It appears to me that all great scientists, such as Feynman, were great philosophers inquiring into the epistemological and metaphysical nature of the very things they were studying which spurned their creative inquiries especially as I recall Feynman's questioning of the nature of energy in my youth. 

The book I have chosen is written by Peter-Godfrey Smith. A biologist and philosopher who per his preface compiled his lectures into this book. The topics cover go in roughly chronological order starting with the logical positivists in the 19th century to modern day sociological and historical treatment of the scientific method and the goal of philosophy in science.

The book provides a good survey of the major milestones over the past century and provides further reading suggestions with each chapter covering a milestone or overall "community circle".

I suggest categorizing the book by chapter and then along with the major points to further identify the following: 
- key people (for followup reading)
- key terms used and definitions (as the philosophy of science has much to do with the use of language and its full context), 
- historical examples.
