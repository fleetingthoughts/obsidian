There are two flavours of DCA. One involves an actual choice and the other is the standard best practice for people earning a stable income:
1) When given a lump sum (say $1M) do you invest it all at once or slowly invest it over a period of time
2) Income earned after expenses invested into your accounts

Only the former involves an actual decision as the latter immediately invests the available income. Research from Vanguard indicates that [lump-sum investment (LSI) has outperformed DCA](Shtekhman%20Dollar-Cost%20Averaging%2020122024-01-27%2014%20-%2005.md) historically two-thirds of the time.  The rationale for DCA is that it minimizes risk by putting in fixed dollar amounts such that less shares are bought during market highs and more bought during market lows, but this is a form a timing in itself and instead of minimizing the risk, DCA only delays the risk. Put another way, equities and bonds have historically outperformed cash in the long run and delaying the cash investment is an opportunity cost.

"DCA" of your regular income is really investing your immediately available income after expenses, so it is in actuality a form of LSI.
