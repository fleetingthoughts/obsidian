### Separations

Separation Process Principles - Seader and Henley
[Distillation Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation_Design)

### Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics
[Thermodynamics and Its Applications- Tester and Modell. Answer key:](https://web.mit.edu/testerel/thermo/)
### Transport Phenomena
- [Transport Phenomena -BSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Phenomena_(book))
	- One of the first textbooks that created the subject of "Transport Phenomena". Geared for Chemical Engineering
## Control Theory
General Control Theory books from the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlTheory/wiki/bookssnc/). Should look into Richard Murray as he even created a [Python Library](https://sourceforge.net/p/python-control/wiki/Home/) for Control Systems ^1541ca

Nise, Ogata, or Richard Murray seem to be recommended a lot for begineers. Richard Murray created the Python Control Systems Library so he's my goat
- _**Feedback Systems: an introduction for Scientists and Engineers**_ - Astrom and Richard Murray
	- Richard Murray has a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Murray) and created a [Python Library](https://sourceforge.net/p/python-control/wiki/Home/) for control systems. Also recommended a lot on [Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3949449/book-suggestions-on-classic-control) to be more intuitive for engineers. The preface for Richard Murray talks about how it de-emphasizes lead/lag compensation and root-locus techniques in favor of more advanced concepts.
- _**Mathematical Control Theory - Deterministic finite-dimensional systems**_ - Sontag
	- This is more mathematical. Recommended on a couple different [Stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1248957/what-is-a-good-source-for-learning-control-theory) posts and it has a pdf online from same link
