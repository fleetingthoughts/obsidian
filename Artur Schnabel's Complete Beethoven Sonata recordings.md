Dubbed the "inventor of Beethoven" by music critic Harold C. Schonberg, Schnabel was the first to record the entire Beethoven Sonatas. 

Schnabel has a lineage to Beethoven ("Beethoven collaborative distance" of 3) himself having studied under Theodor Leschetizky, who studied under Carl Czerny, who was Beethoven's pupil.
