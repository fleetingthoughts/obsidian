Dubbed the "inventor of Beethoven" by music critic Harold C. Schonberg, Schnabel was the first to record the entire Beethoven Sonatas. Done in Abbey Road Studios in London on a C. Bechstein grand piano from 1932-1935.

It should be noted that Schnabel noted in a letter to his wife on Mar. 26 1932 that he remarked the recording studio as a torture chamber. It has been commented that his live performances are vastly different.
