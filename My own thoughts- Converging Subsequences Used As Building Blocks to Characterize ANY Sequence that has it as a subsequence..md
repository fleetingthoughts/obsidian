By [the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem](Understanding%20Analysis%20-%202.5%20Subsequences%20and%20the%20Bolzano-Weierstrass%20Theorem.md), since the subsequence must converge to the same limit as the "original" sequence. If we find any sequence that converges, we can use it as a building block to construct an "original" sequence and that original sequence must converge to the same limit. 

So we can describe any sequence, that we know the convergence of, and it can uniquely <u>characterize</u> any sequences that contains it.
