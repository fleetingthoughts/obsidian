I observed large price discrepancies between online prices and physical store prices by as much as 100% even between stores only a few blocks apart.

This may be due to stores unable to keep the price of their inventory updates. The presence of this arbitrage may indicate that these stores are dependent on the loyal customers who buy into their prices
