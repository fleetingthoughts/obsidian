- Solving the problem of induction
- confirming the consequent
- induction vs explanatory inference, which is more fundamental?
- formulate an inductive logic close to deductive logic (Hempel instead tried to establish a criteria for sound judgement)
	- Hempel established a criteria for sound judgment
	- carnap tried probability 
	- hypothetico-deductivism: see if the logical consequences are true, but there are infinitely many logical consequences that contain nonsense
- Some problems that a good theory of inductive logic must solve (that the logical positivists dealt with)
	-  Raven's paradox: observations also confirm sentences logically equivalent to hypothesis. The observation of a seemingly irrelevant data point confirms original hypothesis:
		- Solution by Hempel: accept it
		- stacked assumptions
		- The order of the observation, relevancy, and refutation
	- Goodman's Riddle of induction: Challenges the idea that an inductive logic is irrespective of the actual content of the arguments and only depends on the form. The words we choose matter and has an inherent subjective bias
