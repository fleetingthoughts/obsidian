We combine the results that we've established between sequences and functions:
- relationship between limit and continuity
- limit of a function described completely in terms of sequence. Limit can be commuted between function operator
- Algebraic limit theorems of functions
- sinx/x by geometry
- 1-cosx/x
- limit of compound function
