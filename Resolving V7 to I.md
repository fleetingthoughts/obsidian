Some voice-leading tips to keep in mind regarding V7 to I resolution
- chordal seventh (scale degree 4) always goes down by a step
- scale degrees 7 and 4 are tendency tones and should never be doubled
- it is common for a complete V7 chord to resolve to an incomplete tonic
- Seth Monohan advises memorizing the scale degrees
Notice that the scale degree 5 can be omitted leading to an incomplete tonic chord. The 3rd scale degree is what really tells us the quality of the chord (is it minor or major) and the 5th is really just fluff. To obtain a complete tonic chord, we have two options available to us:
1) leave an incomplete V7 chord by omitting the chordal fifth. ![](Pasted%20image%2020260211144141.png)
2) Have a complete V7 and tonic chord by let one of the leading tones (scale degree 7th) leap to the fifth if it is an INNER VOICE
