This ultimate collection contains the majority keyboard works of Bach edited by actual musicians and pianists: [Carl Czerny](Carl%20Czerny.md), [[Hans von Bulow]], and [[Ralph Leonard Kirkpatrick]]. The contents of the book and the respective editors are as follows based on my investigation of the individual smaller volumes that this ultimate edition collates
- Inventions and Sinfonias (Carl Czerny)
- English Suites (Carl Czerny)
- French Suites (Carl Czerny)
- Partitas (Czerny)
- The Well-Tempered Clavier Book I-II (Carl Czerny)
- Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor BWV 903 (Hans von Bulow)
- Italian Concerto in F Major BWV 971 (Hans von Bulow)
- Goldberg Variations BWV 988 (Ralph Kirkpatrick)

Some other works published by Schirmer under the smaller constituent volumes, such as the 
Fantasy in C minor, Prelude and Fugue in A minor edited by Hans von Bulow, were excluded due to them being organ and not strictly harpsichord works or incomplete (Fantasy in C minor).
