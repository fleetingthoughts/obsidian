Working on exercise from chapter [2.4 The Monotone Convergence Theorem and a First Look at Infinite Series](2.4%20The%20Monotone%20Convergence%20Theorem%20and%20a%20First%20Look%20at%20Infinite%20Series.md), we furnished a way to determine the limit of recursively defined sequences $(x_n)$ with $$x_{n+1}=f(x_n)$$
Once we establish that the $(x_n)$ sequence converges to a limit $l$, the trick is then to take the limit of the equation $\lim_
