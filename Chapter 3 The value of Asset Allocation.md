Bortolloti focuses on asset allocation mixes between equities and bonds. The majority of the chapter is spent on aligning your target asset class with your financial plans and (underrated) your emotional tolerance for risk. You must find the right asset class mix that let you hit your financial goals and lets you sleep at night

He goes through some data showing that while the annual non-inflation adjusted return of the market is ~8%, the actual annual rate is never that average and usually quite far from it

He then talks about the underlying principles behind having a mixed asset allocation: diversification and correlation. Historically, stocks and bonds are largely independent of each other hence why they make good partners and are the first thing you look at for an asset allocation. There's also another value in diversification: it can reduce risk without sacrificing returns. Typically bonds yield less than equity, but the author brings in the conclusions of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) where the risk and yield of assets should not be viewed individually but rather how it contributes to the overall volatility and yield of the portfolio. MPT has observed in a portfolio, the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts. As an example, adding a risky stock to a moderately risky stock can make it more conservative while obtaining higher yields from the risky stock! You get a free lunch with diversification.
