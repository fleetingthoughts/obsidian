General summary on how to focus and use the slip box method:
9.1 - focus on one task at a time. We
9.2 - Compartmentalize your thinking
9.3 - do not multitask, it makes you less efficient at focusing over time
9.4- learn to be flexible and strive to become an expert. Zettelkasten promotes flexible thinking to avoid unnecessary and wasteful planning. Planning assumes you already have the institutional knowledge to understand how to navigate the field. This more than not leads to mistake. Strive to become an expert who does not need to plan. Think about how little you think with dota and instead recognize patterns. That's the goal
9.5  short term memory is limited and so is general mental space. Remembering "more" by reducing the thing to remember into fewer parts to remember. Also we need closure on our ideas to clear up space. The slip box permits us a goal to accomplish which lets us finish a though with the assurance that it will be remembered. Alternatively, we can leverage the psychology qnnot write it down for it to linger more
9.6. willpower and motivation is the final third resource to be managed. Little research but decision making is one of the most mentally taxing drains on willpower. Zettalkasten takes away the planning and decision making vs the decisions on organization of traditional folder structures. Simplicity in note taking reduces decisions lending to more will power
