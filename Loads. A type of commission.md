Loads are a type of commission involving the sale of a share and are paid to the broker who distributes a mutual fund. 

- Front-end load: commission paid when buying the share
- Back-end load: commission paid when selling the share

Fees that go directly to the mutual funds are redemption fees. Redemption fees are meant to discourage short-term trading and encourage investors to keep their money in the fund.
