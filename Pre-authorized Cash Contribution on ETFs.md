Pre-authorized cash contributions (PACC) are managed by the ETFs not the brokerages.

This was a undeveloped service that has only recently been offered. Looking through forums back in 2020, this was not a feature on Questrade even until very recently and could only be done through paid 3rd party services like Passiv.

Now it seems discount brokerages like Questrade and Wealthsimple offer pre-authorized cash contributions for (ETFs)
