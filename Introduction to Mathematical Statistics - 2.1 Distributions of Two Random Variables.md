We now transfer our understanding of single-variable probability distributions to multivariate distributions.

***Definition 2.1.1. (Random Vector).*** Given a sample space $C$ of a random experiment, if we have two random variables $X_1, X_2$ that map every element of the sample space onto real numbers such that given the element $c$, we have functions $X_1(c) = x_1$ and $X_2(c) = x_2$. We then say the ordered pair of random variables $(X_1, X_2)$ is the random vector and the space, $D$, of $(X_1, X_2)$ is the set of all ordered pairs $D = \{(x_1,x_2): x_1 = X_1(c), x_2= X_2(C), c \in C\}$
