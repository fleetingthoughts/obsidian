In this chapter, Bortolloti makes an understandable emotional appeal to people to leave their advisor who may be a friend, family, etc.. A lot of the information is not relevant to my situation but the few here are:

- Robo-advisors are still managed and may exhibit the bad behaviour of mutual funds, but their MERs are typically lower from the automation. 
	- Typical MERs ~0.5%
	- low minimums to open an account ~1000$
	- Can open socially responsible accounts that put more weight on responsible companies
	- Wealthsimple was one of the first robo-advisors on the scene in 2014
- Online brokerages calling themselves discount brokerages are the favored option by the author. Discount brokerages offer much less fees and they are legally not allowed to give you any financial advice. Some things to look out for in a discount brokerage:
	- Administrative fees: Typically charging a fee for not meeting certain minimum thresholds. May be a good idea to group up investments from family members to avoid these
	- trading commissions: commission on every trade executed. Typically it is $6.95 - $9.95 per trade. Some like Questrade may only charge when you sell and have no commission when you buy
Next the author talks about the types of accounts to open and gives some of his input on whether to invest in a TFSA or RRSP first. Both accounts are tax sheltered and you incurr no taxes on earnings within the. As a rule of thumb he suggest putting in RRSP first if your marginal tax rate is 31%. TFSAs offer less penalties on withdrawal except your effective contribution room decreasing on withdrawals with high-yields. RRSPs  do not provide extra contribution room on withdrawal and is lost forever. Side note: RRSP incurs taxes on withdrawal so it may be more tax efficient to take advantage of home buying or tuition programs to avoid these taxes.

The last portion of the chapter talks about the more practical aspect of leaving your investment advisor for a online brokerage. Though I am not in this scenario, he does have some useful tidbits on the practices of mutual funds:
- Discount brokerages may not be able to hold the assets that you transfer "in-kind"as some funds may hold proprietary assets.
- Transfer of accounts are initiated by the receiving brokerage, so you cannot tell your current advisor to transfer the funds over to another firm.
- When transferring your assets, you may transfer "in-kind" or transfer in cash. The cash option incurrs capital gains from the sale of the assets so "in-kind" transfer is almost always preferable if possible (see the 1st point). 
	- Transferring in-kind usually faster so that you can liquidate to balance your portfolio, whereas large sums of cash will sit in transit.
	- You may be forced to transfer in-cash if there are proprietary assets that the discount brokerage cannot hold
	- Assets with very large number of individual stocks may incur high trading costs compared to the capital gains. In this case, it may be better to transfer by cash It appears trading costs are incurred on each kind of stock and you can't do a batch trade of different kinds of stocks.
- There are predatory practices with mutual funds that may make it difficult for you to leave by incurring charges when an investor leaves:
	- Deferred Sale
